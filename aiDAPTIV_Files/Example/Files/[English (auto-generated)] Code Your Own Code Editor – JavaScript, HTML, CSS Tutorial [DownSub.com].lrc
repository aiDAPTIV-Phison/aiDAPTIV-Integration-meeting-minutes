[00:00.08]Code your own code editor. This course
[00:02.96]shows you how to build a lightweight
[00:04.96]browser-based code editor that runs
[00:07.52]entirely on a single HTML page. You'll
[00:10.63]create tabbed editors for HTML, CSS, and
[00:13.92]JavaScript, complete with an instant
[00:16.64]live preview in a sandboxed iframe. The
[00:20.24]code editor supports keyboard shortcuts
[00:23.27]to keep the editor smooth and fast. You
[00:26.64]will add a validation box for running
[00:29.03]simple JavaScript checks, which makes it
[00:32.00]especially useful for instructors who
[00:34.39]want quick grading options. The project
[00:37.20]also features save and load
[00:39.92]functionality using JSON downloads and
[00:44.07]local storage restore so learners never
[00:47.44]lose progress. Accessibility is built
[00:50.00]with airy states, focus management, and
[00:53.12]full keyboard shortcuts. You will follow
[00:55.84]best practices for reliability with Sri
[00:59.12]pinned CDNs and graceful fallbacks.
[01:02.80]Muhammad Al Abra created this course.
[01:06.24]Hey everyone, today we're building a
[01:08.88]simple in browser code editor you can
[01:11.92]use for lessons, homework or practice.
[01:14.72]Type HTML, CSS and JavaScript, switch
[01:18.72]tabs and watch the results appear
[01:21.20]instantly. You can save your work and
[01:23.68]load it later and run quick checks to
[01:26.56]see if your answers pass. Best of all,
[01:29.52]it runs right in your browser. No
[01:31.84]downloads, no accounts, no setup. By the
[01:34.64]end, you'll have a single page you can
[01:36.79]share with students or friends. Open it
[01:39.52]and start coding. Whether you teach or
[01:41.84]learn on your own, this is a handy tool
[01:44.56]to keep around. So grab your coffee and
[01:47.20]let's open up Visual Studio Code and
[01:49.92]build this project step by step
[01:52.24]together. Nice and easy.
[01:55.36]Imagine handing your learners a single
[01:58.47]web page where they can type HTML, CSS,
[02:03.04]and JavaScript and watch it come alive
[02:06.39]right away. That's what we're building
[02:08.87]today. This editor keeps things simple
[02:12.31]and fast. three focused taps,
[02:16.48]a live preview, and smooth keyboard
[02:19.12]shortcuts. Press Ctrl Enter to run and
[02:22.87]Ctrl S to save so you never lose
[02:26.40]momentum. There's also a validation
[02:29.28]panel for quick JavaScript checks,
[02:32.56]perfect for autograding exercises, and
[02:35.51]giving instant feedback. Everything
[02:38.56]happens inside the browser. No servers,
[02:42.16]no accounts. You can save your work as a
[02:45.04]JSON file and load it back later and
[02:48.80]will also remember your progress with
[02:51.44]local storage. The interface is
[02:54.08]responsive and keyboard friendly and
[02:57.12]it's easy to rebrand for your academy or
[03:00.48]course.
[03:02.31]Let's try now some examples with our
[03:05.12]code editor.
[03:09.44]So here you can see the interface where
[03:12.00]we have three tabs. We have the HTML
[03:14.64]tab, the CSS tab, and JavaScript tab. So
[03:18.56]I've got some ready examples to
[03:21.51]visualize and to try together. Here I
[03:24.72]have example.txt.
[03:26.56]Let's open up this file. And you can see
[03:28.80]we have here a section for the HTML
[03:31.36]language. Let's copy the HTML section
[03:36.00]and paste it right within the HTML tab.
[03:39.44]So you can see here this is the
[03:41.12]interface or this is the you use the
[03:43.36]interface where we have here some
[03:46.64]buttons like clear log. Then we can pass
[03:49.36]into here or paste the HTML. So we have
[03:52.08]a tab click on it. You can see that this
[03:54.87]tab now is activated. It's now active
[03:57.43]where the color is green. And then we
[04:00.31]can run that. You can see now we have
[04:02.23]backbone web page structure. So HTML
[04:05.84]builds the structure for a web page. Now
[04:08.64]let's go and copy the CSS.
[04:15.04]As you can as you can guess if you go to
[04:17.51]the CSS tab here we have another tab
[04:20.47]specialized and specified for CSS. So we
[04:24.24]have separate tabs. We can switch
[04:26.24]between them and go to the CSS. Then if
[04:29.28]we click on run, you can see now the CSS
[04:33.04]has arranged the items in a reasonable
[04:36.24]and beautiful way.
[04:38.96]Let's also copy the functionality of
[04:41.04]JavaScript. So JavaScript adds the live
[04:44.56]to our web page. Let's paste it into the
[04:47.04]JavaScript tab.
[04:49.12]Click on run button. And we can see now
[04:52.00]it's working. If we click on the red
[04:54.16]button, it converts the background color
[04:57.75]of the body element into red and green.
[05:01.12]It turns that into green. Blue, it turns
[05:03.68]it into blue color. Here we can go to
[05:06.56]open preview in a new tab. So we have
[05:08.56]this button that says open preview in a
[05:11.36]new window. Let's click on this nice
[05:13.91]button. And you can see it transfers us
[05:16.88]or it redirects us to a new blank a new
[05:20.00]window that says about blank. Then we
[05:22.40]can click on these buttons to switch
[05:24.72]between the colors. So color switcher,
[05:27.36]this is a nice example that we've tried
[05:29.91]now with our code editor. And as you can
[05:32.24]see, our code editor interprets the
[05:34.96]HTML, the CSS, the JavaScript, and
[05:38.56]converts it into a real web app, real
[05:41.75]ready web app. As you can see here, we
[05:43.44]have the preview section where we
[05:45.28]preview the app or preview the project.
[05:48.24]Let's move on to our next example.
[05:52.47]where I've got another ready example to
[05:54.63]try. Let's copy the HTML
[05:59.84]here. We can delete the HTML and paste
[06:04.56]it the new HTML section also the CSS.
[06:08.24]Let's copy the CSS and paste that into
[06:11.68]the CSS tab. Into the CSS tab, paste.
[06:15.68]You can see now run. We have this to-do
[06:18.47]list. But now if you write anything here
[06:20.63]and do add it doesn't add it. So this is
[06:23.44]a this is a to-do list. Okay. Where we
[06:26.24]can write our to-do. For example, we
[06:27.91]have a to-do of writing a Python
[06:30.88]function. A Python function. But now
[06:33.36]once we click on the add, it doesn't add
[06:35.60]it. Why? Because we didn't because we
[06:37.84]didn't
[06:39.68]paste the JavaScript here. Now let's
[06:43.36]copy the JavaScript
[06:45.60]section and paste it into the JavaScript
[06:48.16]section or JavaScript tab. Now note once
[06:51.36]we click on run and type anything into
[06:54.47]here for example to-do
[06:57.91]write your homework
[07:00.72]then add. Wow it automatically adds that
[07:04.63]to-do as you can see. So our code editor
[07:07.36]is flexible. It accepts HTML, CSS,
[07:11.28]JavaScript or just HTML or for example a
[07:15.19]project just using HTML and CSS but
[07:18.08]without JavaScript. So it is flexible.
[07:20.63]You can run whatever language you need.
[07:23.12]So you can specify what your project
[07:25.19]needs and use whatever language you want
[07:28.47]to use or you would like to use. As you
[07:30.56]can see, now we have a fully working app
[07:32.96]that is utilizing HTML, CSS, and the
[07:36.08]functionality of JavaScript to make this
[07:38.96]app live. Let's add more. For example,
[07:42.31]another to-do like
[07:45.84]writing a writing
[07:49.36]a function in JavaScript. Add it adds
[07:53.68]that. You can see as you can see and
[07:55.68]once we click on it it does a strike
[07:59.36]through for example I've done this. Okay
[08:01.91]now let's move on to the next example to
[08:05.36]try it. Copy this HTML section. Paste it
[08:09.84]into as you can guess. Go to the HTML
[08:12.47]tab. Then you have to focus on this.
[08:14.87]Delete. Paste it into here. Also let's
[08:17.52]copy the CSS code
[08:20.87]or CSS section. paste it into the CSS
[08:23.59]tab. The same goes for the JS. Let's
[08:26.56]copy the JavaScript and paste it into
[08:29.12]the JavaScript tab.
[08:32.32]Now, let's run that. You can run from
[08:34.39]here or you can run with tests. Here we
[08:39.03]have this nice web app that generates
[08:42.24]random quotes. So, every time once we
[08:45.76]click on new quote, the best way to get
[08:47.68]started is to quit talking and begin
[08:49.51]doing. That's a nice quote. And we can
[08:51.92]generate more quotes by clicking on new
[08:54.80]code. Okay. So as you can see we have
[08:57.36]this web app which is a code editor a
[09:00.64]live code editor fully working on the
[09:03.20]browser here. Here we have this task
[09:06.48]assignment panel where a teacher can
[09:09.44]write some tasks here and the student
[09:11.76]can read the task and apply what the
[09:14.56]teacher has said. And also we have here
[09:16.48]a text area for validation tests where
[09:19.60]the teacher can write a some validation
[09:22.80]tests to verify whether the code of the
[09:26.08]student is correct or not. So here
[09:28.39]JavaScript only optional. It's optional.
[09:31.04]Uh this is totally optional. You you
[09:33.60]don't have to write every time some
[09:35.83]tests to verify what the student has
[09:38.39]written. So this is like a verifier that
[09:41.27]verifies whether the code of the student
[09:43.44]is correct or not.
[09:45.27]Now let's try the functionality of the
[09:47.04]saving and loading.
[09:49.36]If we get rid of this for example and
[09:53.60]write a new project here. Let's write
[09:56.88]for example in the HTML let's write the
[09:59.76]let's write a paragraph / paragraph and
[10:02.64]write into here hello world and then
[10:06.64]some ul and put some lists for example
[10:09.92]HTML
[10:11.44]another list CSS
[10:14.16]list
[10:17.04]Java script and lastly list code editor
[10:22.72]and let's run this as you can see here
[10:24.80]we have some elements We have a
[10:26.32]paragraph element with this ul element.
[10:28.72]Let's go to the CSS and write some codes
[10:30.72]into here. So let's let's style our
[10:33.36]elements by going paragraph font size 20
[10:36.80]pixels text align center
[10:41.68]and for example uh color let's set it as
[10:45.76]yellow or for example orange. Run. As
[10:49.68]you can see now we have this styling.
[10:51.76]Let's set the font weight to bolder.
[10:55.76]Run. Now the font weight is bolder.
[10:58.07]Okay. And also let's increase the font
[11:00.80]size 50 pixels.
[11:04.32]So you can see here we have hello world.
[11:06.39]Okay. And also let's style the ul.
[11:10.07]So the ul is an ordered unordered list
[11:12.64]in HTML. Let's give it some styling
[11:14.88]here. For example, you can see here the
[11:17.68]curly brackets here. When we open a
[11:19.76]single curly bracket, it automatically
[11:22.95]creates a closing version of that curly
[11:25.51]bracket. And here we can write some
[11:27.76]styling for the ul as for example
[11:31.76]list style none and also the le. Let's
[11:37.12]go le and set a font size of for example
[11:41.20]20 pixels. Let's run that. You can see
[11:44.00]here let's set here this style to not be
[11:48.56]none. You can see we have some ul with
[11:51.76]these elements here. Let's go to the for
[11:54.16]example JavaScript and do an alert of
[12:00.24]hello world. We can run that. So we have
[12:03.76]an alert hello world. Then it shows us
[12:06.24]our project. Now let's save this
[12:08.16]project. Okay let's save it.
[12:11.27]It now downloads a JSON file. So,
[12:14.72]JavaScript object notation. And this
[12:17.20]JSON file, if we want to later upload
[12:20.72]this project and have it here ready to
[12:23.51]go, we can do that by using this load
[12:27.44]button. So, save it saves a version of
[12:30.63]this project and downloads a file. As
[12:33.68]you can see, if you go to the downloads
[12:35.12]now, downloads, we have this JSON file.
[12:39.20]Let's get rid Let's get rid of them and
[12:41.36]do that again. Let's save another
[12:43.60]version. You can see here we have this
[12:45.51]version. Let's go to the downloads. Now
[12:47.36]we have this version academy. It's named
[12:49.51]academy-web.json.
[12:51.36]And by the way, you can replace the name
[12:53.92]or you can rename it later when we do
[12:56.80]the JavaScript section. You can name
[12:58.39]this file whatever you want. Currently,
[13:00.56]I am naming it academy-web.json.
[13:05.12]Now if we get rid of this HTML. Okay,
[13:08.72]let's remove that. Let's remove all of
[13:10.72]this. Get rid of it. Let's keep anything
[13:13.60]zero and clear log. Run again. We do not
[13:17.51]now we don't have anything. So now we
[13:19.92]have zero styling, zero HTML, zero JS.
[13:23.36]As you can see, you can verify that
[13:24.95]here. Let's now click on the load bin,
[13:27.60]which is a magical button. Load. And
[13:30.48]then let's choose this file which is
[13:32.07]academy web.json.
[13:34.07]open. And you can see now it loads the
[13:37.27]project. And by the way, it loads every
[13:40.39]single language into their into its
[13:42.39]respective tab. So it puts the HTML
[13:45.27]inside the HTML tab. It places the CSS
[13:48.88]into its respective tab which is CSS
[13:52.00]tab. It places the JS into its
[13:54.32]respective tab. And once we click on
[13:56.56]run,
[13:59.04]it execute the JavaScript and also plus
[14:02.16]it executes everything HTML and CSS. So
[14:06.63]this is a nice functionality to save
[14:09.27]your project locally and to load it back
[14:12.63]later. As we said, you can save your
[14:15.12]project and load it back later, which is
[14:17.68]a nice functionality and helpful if you
[14:20.32]work on projects that needs more time to
[14:24.56]continue building it. Okay. So, uh here
[14:29.51]I have another example also. If you go
[14:32.24]to the examples here and choose this
[14:36.48]example, example four. Let's copy the
[14:38.95]HTML. So now we are trying and verifying
[14:42.07]we are we are doing a walk through a
[14:44.48]walk through of our code and exploring
[14:48.07]its features. We are exploring the
[14:50.48]capabilities and the possibilities of
[14:52.88]its uh of its features. Let's paste this
[14:56.56]into the CSS tab and copy the JS and
[15:00.16]paste it into the JavaScript tab. So
[15:03.04]copy
[15:04.72]and paste. Feel free to write whatever
[15:08.16]code you would like in the HTML or CSS
[15:10.39]and JavaScript. And by the way, if you
[15:12.48]write any HTML code or any CSS code or
[15:15.44]any JS code, it will be interpretable by
[15:18.56]our code editor and it will be executed
[15:21.60]as you want. Let's run that. And you
[15:24.00]have here this is our code editor. This
[15:26.07]is what the code we have puted here. So
[15:28.32]now this is what what gets rendered out
[15:31.83]of this code. And here you can see we
[15:33.92]have an RGB mixer where we can mix the
[15:36.32]the colors. So here we have the red
[15:38.00]channel. As you know we have an RGB
[15:39.83]color system. Red channel. Okay. Then
[15:42.80]green channel then blue channel. And if
[15:45.68]you zero all the channels guess what it
[15:49.12]becomes black. So if you zero the red,
[15:52.07]green, blue it becomes black. If we fill
[15:55.12]them if we fill them it becomes white.
[15:58.24]And if we do some ranges of them, if you
[16:00.32]do some mix mixture here and there, here
[16:02.63]and there, you can see we get all every
[16:04.72]single color in the world. Okay.
[16:08.32]And also we can open that and preview it
[16:10.63]in a new tab. As you can see, we get a
[16:12.80]full preview, a full width as you can
[16:15.12]see. And we can play around with the
[16:16.80]colors as we want. Okay. So here you can
[16:20.72]see the values. So feel free to code
[16:23.04]whatever you want. Feel free to try
[16:25.19]whatever code. You can build sliders.
[16:26.95]You can build headers, navbars, footers
[16:29.60]or whole loop sites.
[16:32.80]So here we have clear log button where
[16:35.68]we can uh clear the log. Here we have
[16:38.24]some log. So uh you can try to run this
[16:40.88]app with tests. So it run with tests and
[16:44.80]it displays the time the the current
[16:48.48]time. Here I have the time 4:38.
[16:52.00]You can see here the same time and also
[16:54.16]it's A.M. And also we can run from here
[16:57.19]and have some logs web preview updated.
[17:00.07]So every time we click on this you can
[17:02.32]see it inserts a new span into this area
[17:05.28]saying that web preview updated. But
[17:07.52]every time we click on this button it
[17:09.28]run with tests. Okay. So it tries the
[17:12.24]test mode and we can clear that log and
[17:15.19]here we have notes. Everything runs
[17:17.19]inside the browser in a sandbox. You can
[17:19.91]save the work as a JSON file and restore
[17:22.48]it. So this is was a complete
[17:26.00]walkthrough of the app and its features.
[17:28.48]Here we have these tabs and we can write
[17:30.48]some codes and also here we have the run
[17:32.79]butt in the open and preview the open
[17:35.20]preview in a new window and here we can
[17:37.12]save and load back and also we can clear
[17:40.32]the log or or run the app. And as we
[17:43.36]said this task panel you can write the
[17:45.60]task as a teacher and hand it to your to
[17:50.40]your students and the student will read
[17:52.24]the task and do whatever you want. So
[17:56.40]let's build this project together step
[17:58.40]by step and let's dive into Visual
[18:01.03]Studio Code. Hello world. In today's
[18:05.03]video we will build an exciting project.
[18:09.36]We will build a code editor, an online
[18:12.55]code editor that runs lively in the
[18:15.84]browser. You can see here the structure
[18:18.88]and the layout of this project. First,
[18:21.67]we have a header section that contains
[18:24.55]here a logo and contains this title that
[18:28.96]says code editor live in browser. And
[18:31.36]here we have two buttons save and load.
[18:34.08]This button saves the work and then this
[18:37.12]button load loads a file and loads it to
[18:40.64]this code editor. Here we have the main
[18:43.36]section that contains three subsections.
[18:46.64]First we have a sidebar element here
[18:49.52]task/assignment.
[18:51.03]Here we can write some tasks. For
[18:52.79]example, to-do,
[18:54.96]write a function in JavaScript. And here
[18:58.08]also we have a validation test uh
[19:00.88]JavaScript only. You can write here some
[19:03.60]code like console.log and uh tries to uh
[19:08.00]mimic the code in here. Okay. So we have
[19:10.40]a sidebar for notes for writing some uh
[19:13.91]notes and writing some observations.
[19:16.55]Then we have this the main section here.
[19:19.60]You can see here we have this section
[19:21.52]that contains a title that says HTML/
[19:25.12]CSS/JavaScript.
[19:26.88]And here we have two buttons. The first
[19:29.91]button is run. Runs the HTML, CSS,
[19:33.67]JavaScript in one hit. You can see run.
[19:36.16]It runs the project or it runs this
[19:38.79]code. And here we have open preview in
[19:41.36]window. This button opens in a new
[19:43.67]window. You can see here we have a new
[19:45.44]window that says about blank. Welcome to
[19:48.08]programming ocean academy. And then try
[19:50.00]me.
[19:52.55]Here we have three tabs. HTML. You can
[19:55.03]write HTML code. For example, you can
[19:56.88]write an H1 or H2 element and then write
[19:59.44]here for example programming ocean
[20:02.88]academy or anything else and then you
[20:05.91]can run here run and you can see here we
[20:09.03]have an H2 element and also we have here
[20:12.00]a CSS tab where you can write some CSS
[20:15.44]code for example H2 and then specify the
[20:18.32]color as red. When running you have you
[20:21.84]can see that now we have a color red and
[20:24.24]also we have JavaScript where we can
[20:26.16]write JavaScript code. Okay. So we can
[20:28.88]say here alert and then hello world and
[20:34.00]then run tests. Here we have an alert a
[20:36.79]nice alert in JavaScript. So as you can
[20:39.67]see we have this section to write code
[20:41.84]and here we can preview that work. We
[20:43.84]can view or display the coded work. And
[20:47.67]the last section is output. When we
[20:49.91]click on the run with tests, you can see
[20:52.79]here it run with tests. If you get rid
[20:54.79]of the alert and then run with tests,
[20:57.76]you can see each time it runs the
[21:00.79]project but with tests. Okay. And here
[21:03.52]we have the clear log button that clears
[21:05.36]the log, clears out the log. And here we
[21:07.76]have some notes. Everything runs inside
[21:09.76]the browser is a sandbox. You can save
[21:11.84]the work as a JSON file and and restore
[21:14.15]it. So now let's try to build this
[21:17.12]project step by step. The first thing is
[21:19.84]we have to open a visual studio code
[21:23.28]editor which is my my favorite code
[21:26.15]editor to code web apps. And then let's
[21:29.20]go and new file new window and start a
[21:34.00]new project by going to file and then
[21:37.28]open folder for example.
[21:40.15]Go to the desktop desktop and then let's
[21:42.88]create a new folder in here and name it
[21:45.60]as code editor
[21:51.52]or anything else. Let's name it as for
[21:55.03]example
[21:56.88]my code editor
[22:01.84]and then create a new folder. Here you
[22:04.48]can see
[22:06.40]we have a new window opened with a new
[22:09.28]folder which is my code editor. Let's
[22:11.67]create a file and let's name it as
[22:14.64]index.html.
[22:18.00]Now we have this file index.html
[22:20.72]where we will write our HTML code.
[22:24.00]First, let's use an exclamation mark to
[22:26.96]instantiate or to initialize this file
[22:29.44]with the base HTML 5 code. Document type
[22:33.20]as HTML. We want to specify the doc type
[22:36.24]as HTML. The HTML language as English.
[22:39.60]So, the default language for this web
[22:42.32]HTML is or or for this HTML web page is
[22:46.15]English. And then we have head element
[22:48.40]meta character set UTF8 that supports
[22:51.03]all characters meta name viewport. This
[22:54.15]meta makes the page mobile friendly
[22:57.20]allows the page to be mobile friendly
[22:59.44]and responsive. And here we have title
[23:01.84]document or where where we can write
[23:04.24]here code editor
[23:07.03]for example programming ocean academy.
[23:10.55]And now let's write our code that will
[23:14.79]go into onto the page inside the b
[23:17.52]inside the body tag. First we need as we
[23:20.88]said we need a header tag. Inside this
[23:23.76]header tag we need to create a div
[23:26.40]element with the class container. So
[23:28.88]container and also the class row. As you
[23:31.84]can see we have a div class container
[23:34.15]and also the class row.
[23:36.64]This div element is a block level
[23:39.20]element in HTML and it starts on a new
[23:42.32]line. So it starts on a new line and
[23:44.79]takes up the full available width. So it
[23:47.67]is a block level element and we have
[23:50.15]assigned a class container plus row. So
[23:53.36]we want this div to be in a row in a row
[23:56.24]manner. As you can see here we have here
[23:58.40]the arrow manner way of layout. As you
[24:01.36]can see we have the logo title and here
[24:03.44]we have two buttons. So it's in a row
[24:05.84]layout manner.
[24:08.08]And then inside this div, as you can
[24:10.40]see, we have two sections. We have the
[24:12.55]this which is the metadata about the
[24:15.84]code editor. And here we have two
[24:17.44]buttons. So we have logo and a title.
[24:19.91]Let's create here a div div with a class
[24:24.08]logo. div class logo and keep it like
[24:28.24]that. And let's create another div with
[24:31.27]the class of title. And let's wrap these
[24:34.79]two divs inside a div with the class
[24:37.44]brand. So it represents the brand
[24:39.76]information. Okay. So here we have div
[24:42.00]class brand. Inside it we have div class
[24:44.96]logo that will contain the logo image.
[24:47.52]And here we have div class title. And
[24:49.52]let's write in here the following code
[24:52.88]editor live in the browser.
[25:00.40]and inside and after this div class
[25:02.79]brand let's create another div that will
[25:06.40]contain these two buttons. Now I have a
[25:08.79]question what is the mana or layout mana
[25:11.76]for these two buttons. Is it stacked or
[25:14.72]row? Well, it's in a row manner. So you
[25:18.24]can see these two buttons are managed to
[25:21.84]appear in a row manner or in a row way.
[25:25.03]So let's create a div with the class
[25:27.60]row. And then inside this div class row,
[25:30.08]let's create two button elements. So a
[25:33.60]first button element with a class of btn
[25:36.24]and the class secondary. And let's
[25:38.88]assign an ID of save btn. And let's give
[25:41.84]it a title of save work locally. Save
[25:45.76]work locally. And here let's write in
[25:48.72]here save the word save.
[25:52.64]Also we can wrap it inside the span
[25:54.64]element. So let's write span and then
[25:56.64]write save. After this div after this
[25:59.91]button element let's create another
[26:02.08]button element. So button element with
[26:04.64]the class btn and also secondary. Why
[26:08.24]secondary? Because you can see these two
[26:10.48]buttons appear in a secondary mode.
[26:12.88]Later in CSS we will style the secondary
[26:16.08]class to appear like this. Look. As you
[26:18.96]can see these two buttons are
[26:20.48]transparent and do not have background.
[26:23.12]So here if you return back to these
[26:25.12]buttons here we have the button class
[26:27.20]btn secondary ID as load bin. So let's
[26:31.84]specify the ID as load bin and then
[26:34.64]let's give it a title. Let's assign a
[26:36.64]title as load work file
[26:41.20]and let's write here inside the span.
[26:43.12]Let's write load after this button
[26:46.00]element. So here we have two button
[26:47.67]elements. We're still inside the div
[26:50.72]class row. But after these two buttons,
[26:53.27]let's create an input element. This
[26:56.32]input element of type is of type file.
[26:58.88]So let's go input
[27:01.36]type file. And then let's specify an ID
[27:04.48]as open file. And then the type is file.
[27:09.36]Let's specify here the accept attribute
[27:13.27]as application /json. So that it just
[27:16.79]accepts JSON files. Okay, this input
[27:19.91]file will just accept JSON files. And
[27:22.72]let's here give it the property of
[27:25.12]hidden because why? We do not want to
[27:27.84]show this input. We want we want this
[27:30.72]input to be hidden. We want it to be
[27:32.40]hidden. Now congratulations. We have
[27:35.67]finished building our header element
[27:37.67]successfully. So as you can see this is
[27:39.91]our header element. And if we open this
[27:43.36]file by going to reveal in file explorer
[27:47.03]and going to this file open it we have
[27:49.91]this looking as you can see it's a
[27:52.08]backbone structure code editor live in
[27:54.88]the browser we still don't have a logo
[27:57.52]later in CSS we will define the logo and
[27:59.76]here we have these two buttons but they
[28:01.91]sound like poor buttons. Now let's
[28:06.00]create our main section. So let's go
[28:08.39]ahead and create it. So main and inside
[28:12.24]this main element and by the way if you
[28:14.39]don't know what main section is main is
[28:16.64]a semantic HTML 5 element that signifies
[28:20.79]to the browser that the content that is
[28:23.76]enclosed within the main tag is a the
[28:27.36]main and the core dominant content
[28:29.67]within a web page and every HTML
[28:33.20]document should only contain one main
[28:36.24]element. So it's an h it's an HTML 5
[28:40.96]semantic element and should be used once
[28:43.84]inside each HTML page and it is
[28:46.96]considered uh the content that goes
[28:49.12]within the main tag is considered the
[28:51.67]main dominant core content for this web
[28:55.03]page. Okay. Inside this main tag we want
[28:58.79]to create three subsections. The first
[29:01.67]section is an assigned element and this
[29:04.48]assign element note have the
[29:07.44]architecture of a card. So we have to
[29:09.91]assign the class card and also we have
[29:12.08]the architecture of a panel because it's
[29:14.48]a panel and also it's in a stack mode as
[29:17.12]you can see it goes vertically not in a
[29:20.00]row mode but it goes vertically. So we
[29:22.32]want to assign card panel stack classes.
[29:25.91]Let's go aside
[29:28.39]with the class card stack panel.
[29:34.15]So here we can see we have the class
[29:37.03]card panel and stack. Okay, aside
[29:41.27]element with the class of card panel
[29:43.67]stack. Inside this assign element, let's
[29:46.24]go ahead and create a hidden from the
[29:48.55]second level that says task/assignment.
[29:52.32]So here we have task/assignment. As you
[29:54.72]can see, let's keep the same kind of
[29:57.12]content. And after this heading from the
[29:59.84]second level, also the H2 element is an
[30:02.64]HTML element that signifies to the
[30:05.67]browser that this text is of the second
[30:09.91]heading level importance and it's
[30:12.24]considered the main subheading in the
[30:14.24]web page. So it aids the web page to be
[30:18.15]structured in this manner. we have where
[30:20.48]we have this title that informs the user
[30:23.27]what this panel contains. Informs to the
[30:25.76]user or tells the user what this card
[30:28.24]contains.
[30:30.00]After this H2 element, let's create a
[30:34.00]text area element with the ID of
[30:36.79]assignment.
[30:38.48]This text area element, you can see we
[30:39.91]have a text area here where we can write
[30:42.39]anything we want. Okay, so we have a
[30:45.20]text area element with the ID of
[30:47.27]assignment and let's give it the for
[30:50.55]example class element as text or the
[30:53.36]class set the class attribute as text
[30:56.39]and also we will need to to to put a
[30:58.88]placeholder. Let's write a placeholder.
[31:01.20]Let's write here write the task
[31:04.08]description here
[31:07.12]dot dot dot. So here we have write the
[31:10.24]task description here dot dot and then
[31:13.20]slash text area as you can see. So now
[31:15.84]so now we have a text area element where
[31:18.24]we can write anything we want. If you go
[31:20.48]to our web page reload now we have this
[31:23.27]text area element and as you can see we
[31:25.52]can resize it whichever way we want. You
[31:28.55]can go smaller we can go bigger as as
[31:31.36]you can as as you want. Okay. And write
[31:33.84]here whatever you want. And also by the
[31:35.67]way we have a nice description write the
[31:39.27]task description here dot dot dot after
[31:42.79]this text area element let's create
[31:45.51]another
[31:47.51]div class stack. So let's go div class
[31:51.36]stack. Why? Because it's in a stack
[31:53.91]mode. If you return back to our page
[31:56.08]here we have this stack mode where we
[31:58.32]have a label that says test area and we
[32:01.67]have a text area. So it's stacked
[32:04.39]vertically not in a row manner. So let's
[32:07.20]create here a label element label for
[32:09.76]test area. And then after this label for
[32:13.03]test area, let's close this this this
[32:15.12]label tag and write here validation
[32:18.32]tests JavaScript only. JavaScript
[32:22.55]only dash optional.
[32:25.91]And let's close this bracket. After this
[32:28.32]label tag that says for test area
[32:31.60]validation tests JavaScript only
[32:34.15]optional, let's create another text area
[32:37.12]element with the ID the same as the four
[32:40.08]tag the same as the for attribute. It
[32:42.72]must it must match. So test area and
[32:46.15]then let's give let's give it the class
[32:48.39]attribute as text. Specify class as text
[32:52.08]and write here a placeholder as the
[32:54.96]following. Right. Write simple tests to
[32:59.76]append. Write simple tests to append
[33:03.03]after the students the students code to
[33:07.27]check
[33:09.03]the solution dot and then we should
[33:12.15]close this text area element. So now we
[33:14.72]have created our div class stack. As you
[33:16.96]can see if you go to our page now we
[33:19.03]have another uh div class stack. Now it
[33:21.67]is not styled via CSS. So it will appear
[33:24.55]in this manner like a row manner but
[33:26.79]later when we use CSS we will design it
[33:30.39]to appear like that validation tests
[33:33.44]JavaScript only optional and when we
[33:35.67]click on this label it will focus on the
[33:38.15]text area. So here when we click on the
[33:40.72]label it focuses by default
[33:43.27]automatically it focuses on the text
[33:45.44]area where we can write straight away
[33:48.00]immediately we can write whatever we
[33:50.15]want.
[33:51.84]How? By creating a four property by
[33:55.27]giving the label a four property
[33:58.55]whatever you want test area and also
[34:01.27]specifying the ID for the text area as
[34:04.39]the same value for the four property
[34:07.67]test area.
[34:09.52]After this div class stack, let's create
[34:11.44]another div with the class mute. So div
[34:14.32]class muted. And then let's write in
[34:17.52]here tip. We have a nice tip here. span
[34:21.28]and let's specify the class
[34:24.63]KBD. Now, if you wonder what KBD is
[34:28.48]short for, KBD is short for keyboard.
[34:32.07]So, this is a keyboard hint. This is a
[34:34.63]suggestion hint that will help the user
[34:37.44]to infer what keyboard shortcuts
[34:42.00]uh he can use to interact with the code
[34:45.67]editor. So, here we have control. If he
[34:48.80]if the user press control plus span
[34:52.32]class KBD. So another span element with
[34:56.56]the class property set as KBD. As we
[34:59.92]said KBD is short for keyboard. So Ctrl
[35:03.59]+ S to save. Why? To save the code.
[35:09.44]Okay. So here Ctrl + let's write it in
[35:12.07]capital S. Ctrl + S to save. Comma.
[35:15.83]Let's let's create another span element
[35:18.40]with the class of KBD keyboard control
[35:22.40]and also if the user clicks controll
[35:24.96]plus
[35:28.32]enter to run to run. Okay. So here we
[35:33.35]have a nice tip. If the user clicks
[35:35.83]controll S, he saves the project. He
[35:40.07]wants to save the project to save and
[35:42.64]controll + enter to run the project.
[35:45.68]Okay. If you go back to our code editor
[35:48.00]here, you can see if you go to HTML and
[35:51.76]click Ctrl enter, it runs. You can see
[35:55.11]here it runs the project automatically.
[35:58.32]By clicking on Ctrl enter, it runs the
[36:01.44]project. And if you click ontrl s it
[36:04.48]saves the project. Okay. So here if you
[36:07.83]go back we want to create this type of
[36:10.00]hints. So tip span element class kbd
[36:14.24]controll + s to save and also we have a
[36:17.52]span with class keyboard. Ctrl + enter
[36:20.88]to run. Now we have finished creating
[36:23.83]our aside element. Our first aside
[36:26.24]element. We still within the main tag.
[36:29.20]So we are still living within the main
[36:30.96]tag. Let's create another section
[36:33.59]element with the class of stack. So here
[36:37.59]if you go back
[36:39.83]this is the the section that we want to
[36:41.83]create. Now you can see it's in a
[36:44.00]stacked mode. We have a div element.
[36:46.96]Then we have some division. Then we have
[36:49.28]another area where where we can write
[36:52.00]code. Then we have a preview element
[36:54.48]where we can preview our project. So
[36:57.04]it's in a stacked mode. So let's give
[36:59.28]this section element a class of stack
[37:02.24]and specify the id as web dash only.
[37:07.28]Inside this section element, let's
[37:09.68]create a div element with the class of
[37:13.59]stack
[37:15.11]panel card. So here we have div class
[37:19.28]stack panel card and also let's specify
[37:22.16]the id as web editors. So let's give it
[37:25.20]an id of web editors. Okay, div id web
[37:29.52]editors class stack panel card. Inside
[37:33.20]this div, let's create a div class row.
[37:37.83]So div with the class row. Why? Because
[37:40.96]here inside this first division, we have
[37:45.11]a row layout where where we have this
[37:48.07]title HTML CSSJS and we have these two
[37:51.28]buttons. So let's create here
[37:54.72]let's create here a div with the class
[37:57.68]row and inside it let's create a H2 that
[38:02.80]contains HTML/ CSS/ JavaScript /JS and
[38:08.16]after this second heading level H2
[38:11.52]element let's create a div with the
[38:14.64]class row with two buttons inside it. So
[38:18.24]let's create a button element button
[38:20.32]with the class btn.
[38:22.64]Okay. And let's specify the id as run
[38:25.52]web. So run web. And here also let's
[38:30.07]write in here run. So here we have run.
[38:32.64]Okay. So button class btn. Okay. And
[38:35.83]specify the ID as run web and put the
[38:39.04]text here run or specify the text here
[38:41.35]as run. Okay. So we have a div class
[38:44.40]row. Inside it we have here a button
[38:46.40]element with the class btn. Okay. So
[38:49.28]it's an it's an okay styled btn and the
[38:53.28]id specified as run web. After this
[38:57.35]button let's create another button
[38:59.20]element button element with the class
[39:01.35]btn secondary. So secondary and specify
[39:04.72]the ID as open preview. Open preview and
[39:08.40]write in here preview. So open preview
[39:11.76]in a new window.
[39:14.48]This is the button that we used earlier
[39:16.96]to open the project in a new window. As
[39:19.11]you can see about blank. So here we have
[39:21.52]two buttons, two buttons. Run to run the
[39:24.64]project and we have another button that
[39:26.56]says open preview in new window that
[39:28.88]opens the display of the result of the
[39:32.24]project in a new window.
[39:35.68]Okay. So this these two buttons are
[39:37.92]styled in a row manner. As you can see,
[39:40.00]these buttons are arranged in a in a row
[39:42.72]manner. Run and open preview window.
[39:45.28]After this div class row, let's create
[39:47.83]another div or another division element.
[39:51.52]So after this div class row, let's
[39:53.68]create another division element with the
[39:55.59]class tabs. So let's go div class tabs
[39:59.44]and let's and let's give it the ID as
[40:02.88]web tabs
[40:04.72]and specify the role as tab list because
[40:08.48]it's a tab list and also specify area-
[40:11.76]label as web editors. Now let's discuss
[40:15.83]what these attributes are. So first we
[40:17.92]have a division element. So a block
[40:20.00]level div element with the class tabs.
[40:22.80]Why? Because this div will represent the
[40:25.83]tabs here. This div will contain the
[40:28.80]tabs here. HTML tab, CSS tab, and
[40:32.56]JavaScript tab. Okay. And we also need
[40:36.40]to specify the ID as web tabs. Web tabs.
[40:40.07]You can see we have a capital T and
[40:42.24]specify the role as tab list. Why? This
[40:45.59]role attribute is an important attribute
[40:49.11]for assistive technologies like screen
[40:52.56]readers that helps people that helps
[40:55.20]those with disabilities helps people
[40:57.68]those with disabilities to read the page
[41:00.64]or to identify to identify different
[41:03.28]sections in a web page. So the role of
[41:05.76]this div element is it is a tab list. So
[41:09.35]it's a list of the of of tabs that we
[41:12.00]can click on and switch between the
[41:14.88]different languages. And here we have
[41:17.11]area dash label should be specified as
[41:20.80]web editors to inform the area is short
[41:24.24]for accessible rich internet
[41:27.28]applications. Accessible rich internet
[41:30.80]applications is a set of attributes that
[41:33.83]you that used to add to HTML elements
[41:37.92]the meaningful patterns or the
[41:39.83]meaningful ideas that assisted
[41:42.48]technologies can infer from and tell
[41:45.52]people those with disabilities who use
[41:48.64]our application. So area is a set of
[41:51.68]attributes that can be used with HTML
[41:54.88]tags to add meaning to those HTML tags
[41:59.68]and to make them semantic to make them
[42:02.16]meaningful to assistive technologies
[42:05.04]like screen readers and these
[42:08.00]technologies are used by people with
[42:10.96]disabilities. So here we have area-
[42:13.52]label as web editors. So this div
[42:16.16]contains the tabs the different tabs of
[42:18.72]the languages. As you can see we have
[42:20.24]HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
[42:25.59]Now let's go
[42:28.48]to
[42:30.24]here
[42:32.40]and create our tabs. So inside this div
[42:35.68]class tabs, let's define a button
[42:39.04]element. create a button element with
[42:41.76]class of tab active because by default
[42:45.20]the first tab the first HTML tab is the
[42:48.24]active tab and let's define here the
[42:51.83]role as tab and give it the area area
[42:56.07]dash selected true why because it's the
[42:59.92]default tab here we have HTML and it is
[43:02.31]the default tab as you can see
[43:05.28]HTML is the default tab by default it is
[43:08.48]selected if you If we rerun the page,
[43:10.88]reload the page, by default the HTML tab
[43:13.92]is the selected tab. So we have to
[43:16.40]specify for this property area- selected
[43:19.76]equals true. Again, what does area stand
[43:22.16]for? Area is short for accessible rich
[43:25.68]internet applications. And what is area?
[43:29.11]area is a set of attributes that can be
[43:32.88]added to HTML elements to provide
[43:36.64]meaning and to provide meaningful
[43:39.35]behaviors about these elements because
[43:41.68]the div element and the button element
[43:43.59]alone doesn't give the assistive
[43:45.83]technologies enough info about what what
[43:48.72]these tabs do what is this tab HTML
[43:51.92]because those people with disabilities
[43:54.16]who have some problems in seeing or some
[43:56.56]problems with hearing who cannot use
[43:58.96]devices as well will not understand what
[44:01.59]these tabs do. So we want to inform them
[44:04.31]that this is a list of tabs. So here you
[44:06.88]can see the role is specified as tab
[44:10.24]list. So it's a list of tabs. It's a
[44:13.28]collection of tabs and each button has
[44:16.80]the role of tab. So this property helps
[44:19.83]the assistive technologies like screen
[44:22.16]readers to identify the role and the
[44:24.48]behavior of each button. And here let's
[44:26.96]let's specify the tab index as zero. So
[44:29.68]the tab index property equals zero.
[44:32.31]Data-pane equals
[44:35.52]data-pane
[44:37.28]equals HTML.
[44:39.83]HTML. And let's inside this button write
[44:42.88]HTML.
[44:44.72]The same goes for the rest of the
[44:46.56]languages. So button class tab. But note
[44:50.72]this time the CSS tab isn't active. So
[44:54.00]we shouldn't give active. We shouldn't
[44:56.24]write active here. So we should not
[44:59.11]activate the CSS tab. So button
[45:03.11]button class tab. And let's give it the
[45:05.76]role as tab because it's a tab. It's a
[45:08.24]CSS tab. And then we have data or area-
[45:12.16]selected equals
[45:14.80]false. Let's write here false. And also
[45:18.00]let's specify the tab index as minus
[45:20.48]one. And here we have data-pane equals
[45:23.52]CSS. And let's close that button
[45:25.59]element. And write in here within these
[45:28.31]the opening button tag and the closing
[45:30.88]button tag. Let's write in here CSS.
[45:36.24]Then let's create our third button. So
[45:38.80]button element class tab. And we
[45:41.68]shouldn't give it we shouldn't give it
[45:43.92]active. We shouldn't write here active
[45:45.92]because it's not activated by default.
[45:48.00]specify the role as what tab because
[45:50.88]this is the JavaScript tab where we can
[45:53.11]switch between the languages and choose
[45:55.04]different tabs. So we want to help
[45:57.68]people with disabilities to area-
[46:01.52]selected to infer that the area selected
[46:05.11]here is false. It is not selected by
[46:07.83]default. The selected tab is HTML tab
[46:11.76]and then also specify or identify the
[46:15.11]tab index as minus one and give it data
[46:18.07]dash pane equals JavaScript
[46:21.59]and close this button and write in here
[46:24.16]JS or write the full version JavaScript.
[46:28.72]Now we have finished creating our div
[46:30.96]class tabs
[46:33.20]section. Let's create another div. So
[46:36.40]div element with the class of editor
[46:38.64]wrap. So editor wrap
[46:42.16]inside this div class editor wrap. Let's
[46:45.59]specify here data dash pane equals html
[46:48.96]and specify in here another div with the
[46:52.24]id of editor and html and give it the
[46:55.83]class of editor. So as you can see we
[46:58.88]have a div class editor wrap data pane
[47:02.48]specified as html. This is the editor
[47:04.88]wrap for HTML language. And inside we
[47:07.83]have another div with id editor html and
[47:12.07]and the class is editor. And let's leave
[47:14.24]this div div ele element empty. And
[47:16.72]close this div like that. Okay. So we
[47:20.48]have left the div element as empty.
[47:24.56]Let's create another div element. div
[47:27.11]class. So let's create a div with the
[47:29.59]class editor wrap. The same idea. div
[47:32.88]class editor- wrapper. So this is the
[47:35.20]wrapper for the editor. This is the
[47:37.20]wrapper here, the wrapper for the
[47:39.52]editor. And then create inside this div
[47:43.52]another div element with the class
[47:46.40]editor and specify the id as editor css.
[47:51.76]So you should focus on this property id
[47:55.28]specified as ed which is short for
[47:57.92]editor editor html and we have and and
[48:00.96]here we have div id editor css and let's
[48:04.56]specify in here data-pane
[48:07.11]css
[48:08.96]the last language javascript so div
[48:11.28]class editor-
[48:13.92]data-pane specified as js javascript and
[48:17.83]here we have we need to specify here the
[48:20.64]div with the ID as editor_js and the
[48:24.07]class editor. Okay, like that. Now, if
[48:27.20]you go to our web page and reload, we
[48:29.44]have these two uh we have these three
[48:31.35]tabs. HTML tab, CSS tab, JavaScript tab.
[48:35.04]And by the way, we have to keep these
[48:39.04]hidden. So here we have to keep the CSS
[48:43.28]editor wrap hidden by writing here
[48:46.00]hidden. The property a hidden is a
[48:48.96]global attribute in HTML that hides
[48:52.16]whatever element you append the hidden
[48:54.72]tag to it. So we now we are appending
[48:57.04]the hidden tag the hidden property the
[48:59.35]hidden attribute to the div class editor
[49:01.59]wrap which will hide this editor wrap
[49:05.04]specified for CSS. The same goes for
[49:07.28]JavaScript. Let's hide the editor wrap
[49:10.07]that is specified or specialized for
[49:12.31]writing JavaScript.
[49:14.88]After these editor wraps, let's create a
[49:17.92]div class stack. So div class stack.
[49:21.52]This div class stack is here. If you go
[49:24.07]back to our code editor here, we have a
[49:27.76]H3 element with the text preview. And we
[49:31.04]have this nice iframe that will display
[49:33.76]our project's result. So let's go. We
[49:36.72]have div class stack stacked vertically.
[49:39.35]We have an H3 element with the title
[49:42.88]preview. And let's create a an an iframe
[49:45.52]element. I frame element with the ID
[49:47.83]preview class specified as preview. And
[49:51.28]then let's create a sandbox property.
[49:53.92]Now you may wonder what is iframe
[49:56.00]element? I frame is an HTML element that
[49:59.52]displays or shows content or that embeds
[50:04.24]embeds content from another window into
[50:07.11]the current web page window. So iframe
[50:10.16]is an HTML element that embeds content
[50:13.35]from another web page or from another
[50:15.76]window into the current live working web
[50:18.72]page. And we have to specify the sandbox
[50:21.52]property. And also you may have question
[50:23.92]what is the sandbox property? Sandbox
[50:26.31]property is a property that is used to
[50:29.52]provide the iframe element with what is
[50:32.96]allowed and what is not allowed. what
[50:36.24]should be allowed to be embedded to this
[50:39.04]if frame element. So it defines a set of
[50:42.31]restrictions that will define the limits
[50:45.83]of this iframe element by going allow
[50:48.80]dash scripts allow dash same origin and
[50:54.72]also allow dash models. So here you can
[50:58.00]see
[51:00.16]to this iframe element when we write a
[51:02.40]JavaScript here and for example alert
[51:05.20]hello
[51:06.72]and run that it shows a model. If we
[51:10.00]don't specify this tag here allow models
[51:13.11]it will not show this model. It won't
[51:16.16]display this model. And also allow
[51:18.96]scripts. This is an important property
[51:21.28]that allows displaying the scripts
[51:23.92]written in here written here. Okay. So
[51:26.24]here we have three important tags allow
[51:28.72]scripts allow same origin allow-same-
[51:32.80]origin and allow models and also you can
[51:35.92]do the following allow- forms if you
[51:38.96]want to allow the forms. Okay, so this
[51:41.92]is a sandbox property creates a
[51:45.28]sandboxed version of the iframe. creates
[51:48.88]a sandbox environment of the iframe and
[51:52.00]specifies the restrictions and specifies
[51:54.80]the limitations of this iframe. We we
[51:57.52]just want to allow scripts, allow same
[52:00.40]origin, allow models and allow forms.
[52:03.68]Now congratulations, we have finished
[52:06.00]creating
[52:07.76]our uh main section. As you can see,
[52:10.16]this is our backbone web page. We have a
[52:13.04]header. We have this sidebar element.
[52:15.35]And we have this main element that
[52:17.20]contains three tabs HTML, CSS,
[52:20.24]JavaScript. And we have a preview. And
[52:22.55]our work will be shown here will be uh
[52:25.83]you will be shown or displayed in this
[52:27.83]preview element. Okay.
[52:32.40]Let's go ahead and tackle the the last
[52:35.28]sidebar element. And it is considered an
[52:37.83]easy element by going after the after
[52:40.64]the section element after right after
[52:43.11]the section element but we still within
[52:45.68]the main element let's create an aside
[52:48.00]element aside with the class of stack
[52:52.64]panel card or stack card panel whichever
[52:56.80]order you can put here card panel stack.
[53:01.20]You can swap that order the other way
[53:03.59]around. So whichever way you put it, it
[53:06.40]goes well. Here we have an aside element
[53:09.35]class card panel stack. And let's write
[53:11.83]in here. As you can see, we have this
[53:13.35]nice H2 element. H2 element that says
[53:16.40]output. So let's write in here H2
[53:19.11]output.
[53:20.64]And after this H2 element, which is a
[53:23.11]second level hidden, let's create a div
[53:26.24]with the class of out and specify the id
[53:30.40]property as output. So div with the id
[53:33.76]output class out and let's write here
[53:36.55]area-live
[53:38.24]equals polite. So what does area-live
[53:42.07]means? Area lives informs the assisted
[53:45.20]technologies like screen readers that
[53:48.48]this div element will contain a
[53:50.48]dynamically changed content uh without
[53:54.40]reloading the page or without user
[53:56.88]interaction with the code. So here we
[54:00.07]will have a modified section here when
[54:03.20]we every time we if we get rid of the
[54:05.68]alert get rid of the alert every time we
[54:08.31]run this code we will have a div that is
[54:11.44]being inserted we have some element
[54:14.00]being inserted into this section so this
[54:17.20]area will have a area alive so the mode
[54:21.59]here is area- alive you can set it as
[54:25.44]three three elements assertive of or
[54:28.55]polite. In this case, we have to use
[54:31.04]polite. Why? Because we want to insert
[54:34.16]politely insert some elements, okay, to
[54:37.11]this div. So, we have a dynamically
[54:40.00]changeable content that uh the content
[54:42.72]of it of this div will change
[54:44.72]dynamically without the need to reload
[54:48.24]the page. So, here we have a dynamically
[54:50.96]changeable content without the need to
[54:53.20]reload the page. You can see without
[54:55.59]needing to reload the page and also
[54:57.28]without the need to use any user
[54:59.20]interaction
[55:02.40]after this div element ID output class
[55:05.11]out and then area live polite. Let's
[55:07.59]create a div with the class row. Why?
[55:09.92]Because we have this row manner or row
[55:13.11]layout two buttons styled in a row way
[55:16.96]in a row layout manner arranged in a
[55:20.24]row. And then let's create here a button
[55:23.59]element. So button element let's write
[55:25.68]here button button element with the
[55:28.80]class btn warn warning. And then let's
[55:32.07]write in here
[55:34.55]run with tests. And let's give it let's
[55:37.59]provide it with the ID of run tests.
[55:41.92]Here we have this button that says run
[55:44.40]with tests. You can see it's in it's in
[55:46.72]a warning manner. So this button is an
[55:48.88]is have has an okay class. This button
[55:52.79]has an okay class. This button has a
[55:55.68]warn class. And these three buttons have
[55:58.55]a secondary class. So whichever button
[56:02.24]here that has the secondary class here.
[56:06.00]You can see we have these uh these two
[56:08.00]buttons have the secondary class. It
[56:11.11]will be shown as this transparent
[56:14.31]background. But the button element
[56:18.00]that has a class of okay like in here
[56:21.52]button class btn okay it will be showed
[56:24.55]or displayed like this
[56:27.52]okay styled button and whichever button
[56:31.52]or every button that has the worn class
[56:34.24]here if you go down the worn class it
[56:37.83]will be showed or displayed like this in
[56:39.92]a yellow in a yellowish or orang-ish
[56:42.79]color. Okay. So here we have a a button
[56:45.68]element class btn class warn ids set as
[56:50.31]run tests. So here we have run tests and
[56:53.20]right in here run with tests. After this
[56:56.00]button let's create another button but
[56:58.64]this time with the class btn secondary
[57:01.28]you can see the styling the way of this
[57:04.00]btn is in a secondary mode. So this
[57:08.00]button is this button is a is in a
[57:11.11]warning mode. This btn is a is an okay
[57:14.00]mode in a successful mode. Successful
[57:16.64]mode and then let's write in here clear
[57:20.16]log clear log. This button will do the
[57:23.59]clearing of the log. So it will clear
[57:25.59]the log. Clear the log. Okay. After this
[57:29.59]div class row, let's create another h3
[57:33.52]element with the text notes. So here we
[57:36.96]have notes. You can see notes. And let's
[57:39.28]create here a ul element. So unodudit
[57:42.72]list
[57:44.48]with the class muted. So you can see
[57:47.35]here we have just two elements with the
[57:49.35]class muted. We have this info. The
[57:52.16]hints, the suggestions for the user to
[57:54.88]use are inside a div with the class
[57:57.52]muted. And here also we have a ul, a
[58:00.40]nice unordered list with the class
[58:02.88]muted. So you can see the color is uh in
[58:06.79]a grayish mode in a gray mode. Why?
[58:09.20]Because it's in a muted mode. muted
[58:11.44]silent. Okay, so the ul class muted and
[58:15.04]here we have the lee element lee element
[58:19.28]that says everything runs in the inside
[58:23.92]the browser. The browser
[58:28.72]browser
[58:31.76]is uh is in a sandbox in a sandbox.
[58:37.68]And then let's write another lee
[58:38.96]element. Lee list. Let's write in here.
[58:41.83]You can save
[58:43.76]you can save the work as a JSON file. As
[58:47.59]a JSON file and restore it dot dot dot
[58:52.79]dot. So here we have a ul an ordered
[58:55.52]list that contains two elements, two
[58:57.83]items. Everything here let's write
[58:59.76]everything. Everything
[59:02.48]runs inside the browser is a sandbox or
[59:05.92]in a sandbox. And we have another lee.
[59:08.07]You can save the work as a JSON file.
[59:10.31]The same as in here. Everything runs
[59:12.55]inside the browser in a sandbox. You can
[59:14.72]save the work as a JSON file and restore
[59:16.88]it. And here we have it like that. So
[59:20.79]congratulations. We have finished
[59:22.88]building the main section of the page.
[59:25.59]Now let's move on to the easiest section
[59:28.48]which is the footer. My favorite
[59:30.40]section. So footer or div. Let's create
[59:33.11]a div class footer. Give it the class
[59:36.79]footer. Provide the div with the class
[59:39.20]futa and write in here the copyright
[59:42.96]assign like this. And then 2025. Okay.
[59:48.55]2025
[59:50.07]uh programming ocean academy
[59:54.96]all rights reserved. And let's get the
[59:59.59]copyright symbol by going copyright
[60:03.44]symbol HTML. And here if you go to W3
[60:08.55]schools
[60:10.31]go down here you can see the copyright
[60:13.44]using this entity. So we have HTML
[60:15.52]entities and we have a a a numerous
[60:18.00]items here. All these are considered as
[60:20.48]HTML entities. If you want to use any of
[60:22.64]those you can just copy the entity as
[60:25.04]here. for example the euro the euro
[60:28.00]symbol or the trademark symbol or the
[60:30.79]left arrow and so on so on so here we
[60:33.28]have the copy entity let's copy it and
[60:35.83]use it over here the copy entity and
[60:39.59]copy semicolon and also I can write it
[60:41.83]so and copy semicolon which is quite fun
[60:44.55]to write entities in HTML now let's go
[60:47.44]and reload this page and we have here a
[60:49.83]nice copyright symbol followed by the
[60:54.07]year 2020 25 programming ocean academy
[60:57.68]all rights reserved and this is the
[60:59.92]footer element and by doing so we've
[61:02.55]finished creating our HTML section now
[61:08.24]let's do the final thing now we have
[61:10.79]created our backbone HTML web page let's
[61:14.24]create a CSS file here styles dot CSS
[61:19.35]and let's link this CSS file to this
[61:22.16]HTML so let's do this part now to finish
[61:25.04]from it here. Let's go to the head
[61:27.20]section. Let's move on to the head
[61:29.35]section and create a link element or
[61:32.72]write link relation stylesheet href.
[61:36.72]Let's connect this HTML page to the CSS
[61:40.07]file by going style.css
[61:43.04]styles.css.
[61:45.11]You have to be aware of which which name
[61:47.83]you chose. Is it styles or style? In
[61:50.40]this case, I have styles. CSS and I have
[61:53.76]linked this HTML page to this CSS web
[61:57.44]page. Okay. Or to this or to or to this
[62:00.48]CSS file. Let's make sure that we don't
[62:03.04]have any errors. Reload. Go to the
[62:05.59]console. We don't have any errors. Any
[62:08.00]errors. And we can verify that by doing
[62:10.64]another test, a little test. Let's do
[62:13.59]body background red,
[62:17.44]which is not my favorite color, but this
[62:19.44]is for the testing. uh uh see uh for the
[62:22.07]testing purpose and in here we have
[62:25.59]background red. So now we have verified
[62:28.64]that our HTML page is correctly
[62:31.68]successfully perfectly linked to this
[62:34.16]CSS file and also let's create the
[62:38.31]JavaScript file. So let's create
[62:40.64]script.js
[62:42.64]and let's link this script file link it
[62:46.72]to our HTML page. How? by going to the
[62:49.83]slashbody element here slashbody and
[62:53.04]right before the slash body let's create
[62:55.92]a script element or a script element
[62:59.35]that contains the src property or
[63:02.55]attribute that links to this file
[63:06.16]script.js JS and let's go in the in the
[63:09.04]HTML reload verify that by the console
[63:12.40]we do not have any errors we don't get
[63:15.03]any errors which means we've
[63:17.11]successfully linked to it but another
[63:19.52]test little test we can do console.log
[63:22.40]log hello world and also we can do let's
[63:25.76]do alert hello universe
[63:30.72]and let's go ahead run again we have an
[63:34.00]alert that says hello universe and we
[63:36.24]have also a console here that says hello
[63:38.72]world now we have verified that we've
[63:41.28]linked perfectly correctly
[63:43.92]this is the JavaScript to our HTML okay
[63:46.55]so let's get rid of this these two
[63:48.40]elements
[63:50.96]and Now I can say that we've finished
[63:54.00]creating our HTML successfully. Now we
[63:56.96]will move on to writing our CSS and
[64:00.00]bring the styling decorations to our web
[64:03.59]page. So see you in CSS. Now let's dive
[64:07.44]into styling and decorating our web
[64:10.31]page. Let's move on to the file
[64:13.68]styles.css
[64:15.35]and let's dive in. First let's define
[64:18.64]our colors variables by going root
[64:24.48]root and then as you can see we have
[64:26.55]colon mark root or colon symbol root the
[64:29.76]root selector. Let's define here the
[64:32.24]d-ash background bg is short for
[64:35.11]background as h#0 f121.
[64:40.88]And then let's define the body
[64:43.20]background as hash 0 B 0 F1D.
[64:48.72]So 0 B
[64:51.11]0 B 0 F1D.
[64:54.55]Then let's define the panel the panel
[64:57.20]color as 141 82B.
[65:01.44]Also we need the muted color as 8B 9387.
[65:06.00]If you recall the muted the the muted
[65:08.31]div here that we have created here the
[65:10.96]tip and also these two list items. So
[65:14.16]these are the muted items and also we
[65:16.48]need the txt variable as e9 cf1.
[65:22.64]Let's create the brand also. We need the
[65:24.55]brand color. Our brand color is 7D3FC
[65:29.35]brand-2
[65:31.11]color as 60 A5A.
[65:34.88]Also let's define the okay the okay
[65:37.83]button background the color as2 C5e
[65:43.11]also the warning button as btn E A B308
[65:49.11]and let's put here a hash mark
[65:52.00]and let's define the er the error button
[65:55.44]background color as E F444
[66:01.20]and lastly let's define the radius s
[66:05.52]variable as 18 pixels and also the gap
[66:09.03]as 14 pixels. So these are all of the
[66:12.48]variables that we would use across and
[66:16.00]along coding the CSS code. First let's
[66:21.59]reset the default margin padding box
[66:24.96]sizing for all elements. So a star in
[66:28.00]CSS, a star symbol refers to all
[66:31.20]elements, refers to every single element
[66:33.76]inside a web document. Let's reset the
[66:36.40]margin, the default margin for the
[66:38.96]elements to zero. Let's reset the
[66:41.03]padding to zero. And let's reset the box
[66:43.44]sizing. Box sizing equals border box.
[66:47.59]Now we will see every single effect of
[66:51.92]these codes. Now notice with me when we
[66:55.20]reload the page it will have a margin.
[66:57.92]All of these elements will have a margin
[67:00.31]of zero, padding of zero and the box
[67:03.03]sizing reset to border box.
[67:06.72]Now we don't have any margins. We don't
[67:09.03]have any padding. We've zeroed out all
[67:11.52]of the margins paddings the default
[67:13.76]margins and paddings that was added by
[67:16.96]default by the browser. the browser
[67:19.68]Chrome browser or Firefox or any browser
[67:22.64]adds some default styling like margin
[67:25.68]like padding for the H2s for the text
[67:27.83]area text and we have reset them to be
[67:31.03]all as zero. Okay, so we can define them
[67:34.31]by ourselves. Now let's move on to
[67:38.40]the HTML, body elements and set the
[67:42.07]height as 100%. So now we need to set
[67:45.68]the height. The height property is a
[67:47.83]property in CSS that sets what is the
[67:50.72]length of an element. What is the height
[67:53.03]of an element and we need to set it as
[67:56.24]100%. Now if you see here this the page
[67:59.59]it has a 100% height. This is the HTML
[68:02.72]and the body tag. Okay.
[68:06.79]Now let's dive into the body element. So
[68:09.28]the body element we need to set a font
[68:12.00]dash family as sans- surf as sand surf.
[68:16.48]So now if you if you if you see with me
[68:18.48]now we have all of these texts you can
[68:21.60]you can see in a sans surf font family.
[68:25.35]So we've set the font family to be sand
[68:28.40]surf and let's so font family is the
[68:31.35]type of the font which font you want to
[68:33.60]use you would like to use to set for the
[68:36.08]body element and all its children and
[68:38.71]also let's set the background the
[68:40.31]background color to be as the following
[68:43.04]linear-gradient
[68:45.35]and let's define here 180° so 180° the
[68:50.71]gradient degree and let's use a variable
[68:53.44]of the body background ground. So that
[68:55.83]variable that we've set earlier and
[68:57.83]let's use a variable of the background
[69:00.48]and here let's put the percentage as
[69:03.60]35%age
[69:06.15]and let's set the the color as the
[69:08.15]variable txt. Okay. So now note with me
[69:11.92]let's reload the page. Now we have this
[69:14.48]background color for the body set to a
[69:17.52]background linear gradient. So it is a
[69:20.71]linear gradient color with a degree of
[69:24.08]180°. Feel free to adjust that degree by
[69:27.04]going to the console and going to the
[69:29.04]body element here. Then adjusting the
[69:31.35]degree as you want. So you can you can
[69:34.00]swap this degree to to whichever degree
[69:36.23]you want here. So you can move that
[69:38.88]degree whichever degree you want. Okay.
[69:41.27]And also feel free to change any of
[69:43.04]these colors.
[69:46.15]And also we've defined the color to be
[69:48.15]as the text color. Recall that this text
[69:50.88]variable is this variable which has this
[69:53.04]YT color which is E9 EC F1. Let's move
[69:57.19]on to the next element which is header.
[70:00.23]Now we need to set the padding of 20
[70:02.40]pixels. Also let's set the background as
[70:05.76]background color. So redefine the
[70:08.15]background color as linear-gradient
[70:12.80]to be one uh 90° 90° RGBA. Let's use a
[70:18.00]RGBA color. 96 for the red channel
[70:21.60]value, 165 for the green channel, and
[70:26.00]250 for the blue channel. And let's put
[70:28.96]here a a alpha value of 0.15. So the
[70:32.48]alpha represents the opacity of the
[70:34.64]color. And also let's set an RGBA color
[70:38.80]by
[70:40.88]125,
[70:42.64]211 for the green channel. And for the
[70:45.76]blue channel, let's set a value of 252,
[70:49.92]0.1 for the alpha channel. Here you can
[70:53.28]see we've misspelled the background.
[70:55.12]Let's write it correctly. Background.
[70:58.48]And let's put a semicolon at the end.
[71:01.44]And let's set the border-bottom. So
[71:04.08]border bottom to have a one pixel uh one
[71:07.67]pixel of the thickness. So the thickness
[71:09.44]is one pixel solid. The type of the
[71:11.60]border is solid. not for example uh
[71:14.23]groove or not for example uh dotted but
[71:17.44]instead we we need to use solid solid
[71:20.71]type and also let's set a a background
[71:23.76]color of rgba 255 255 255 opacity of the
[71:28.64]value 0.06 06. Now you can see the
[71:32.64]header element will have a padding of 20
[71:34.80]pixels. Note with me this header element
[71:37.44]will have a padding of 20 pixels and
[71:40.15]also uh and also set the background to
[71:43.28]have a linear gradient of 90°. So the
[71:46.32]gradient is moving in a 90° way and
[71:48.80]having these two colors RGBA and this
[71:51.28]RGBA color. You can uh feel free to
[71:53.52]adjust them to whatever you want. And
[71:55.28]here we have the border button to have
[71:57.12]border from the bottom side. So we can
[71:59.04]set a border from the top side, left
[72:01.28]side, bottom side or right side. Now we
[72:04.15]have a border bottom from the bottom
[72:06.00]side. And to to verify that it's it is
[72:08.48]working, we can set it to 10 pixels to
[72:10.96]see it very well. Now we have here a
[72:13.04]border bottom of thickness 10 pixels.
[72:16.08]But let's keep it
[72:18.32]little a little bit uh uh lighter one
[72:21.44]pixel and reload. Now you can see we
[72:24.15]have a border button. Let's move on to
[72:26.32]the container element. the container
[72:28.56]element. Recall in the HTML we've
[72:31.19]created inside the header element a div
[72:34.00]element with a class of container. This
[72:36.56]container will contain the elements and
[72:38.96]center them and center them in the page
[72:41.36]will make them centered well in the
[72:43.44]page. Not for example having the full
[72:45.67]available width but rather centered like
[72:48.32]this centered. You can see the the
[72:50.40]content is centered not starting from
[72:52.71]here but start from here. And this is a
[72:54.64]visual appealing visually appealing way.
[72:57.92]Okay. So how to do that? Simply by
[73:01.36]setting the maximum width. So this is an
[73:03.92]important property in CSS that sets the
[73:06.88]maximum width an element can have. Okay,
[73:10.64]which is in this case 1,200
[73:13.92]pixels. So 1 1,200
[73:17.92]pixels. And let's set here a margin in
[73:20.48]line. So if you if you want to see this
[73:23.36]look now
[73:25.36]this element now is having the container
[73:28.00]element here
[73:29.92]you can see it is having here a 1,200
[73:33.84]pixels the width the width of the
[73:36.08]element and we can set here the property
[73:38.96]of margin-line.
[73:40.80]So margin in line as auto and let's set
[73:44.15]the padding of 14 pixels. Let's give it
[73:47.52]a padding and let's justify dash content
[73:50.80]space between. Okay, you can see now the
[73:53.92]container is having padding of 14
[73:55.92]pixels.
[73:57.44]Reload the page. Now we have some
[73:59.04]padding added to this. So the padding is
[74:01.36]the inner spacing, the inner and the the
[74:04.23]inter spacing of the element and margin
[74:06.80]in line as auto. It margins the content
[74:09.92]as auto and justify content space
[74:12.40]between it uh center the element and
[74:15.12]make them and make it space between
[74:17.12]having some space between elements.
[74:20.64]Next let's go to the brand and sell the
[74:23.28]brand element. Recall that brand element
[74:25.76]is this div that contains two subdivs
[74:29.92]logo and title. So these two elements
[74:32.40]the logo which is not appear yet not
[74:35.92]displayed yet and this title live within
[74:39.36]a element div which has the class of
[74:43.60]brand. So brand should have a line dash
[74:46.32]size. So let's set display display as
[74:50.64]flex and also align
[74:53.84]items align dash items as center. Also,
[74:57.76]let's set a gap of 10 pixels and font
[75:01.04]weight as 700. So, all we're doing here
[75:04.32]is we are setting the display mode of
[75:06.80]the brand element as flex. Why? Because
[75:09.67]we want to deal with this brand as a
[75:11.92]flexbox element as a flexible box
[75:14.32]element. And flex is an a newer or a new
[75:19.28]styling added to CSS version 3. So
[75:22.64]flexbox is a layout module added to CSS
[75:26.80]3 or has come by by the CSS3 version and
[75:31.19]it it is used to style and arrange
[75:33.60]elements in a one dimension layout. So
[75:36.08]if you want to arrange elements in a 1D
[75:38.32]layout you can use display as flex. So
[75:41.76]suitable suitable here let's write here
[75:44.80]suitable
[75:47.12]for
[75:49.92]onedimensional
[75:51.76]layout structures and here we have align
[75:55.60]items center. If you if you see now
[75:58.88]reload the uh reload the page you can
[76:01.12]see we have now a title and the logo
[76:03.67]which is isn't isn't here yet but when
[76:06.71]we add it we we will have here a logo
[76:09.04]and this title as code is live in the
[76:11.84]browser. So all we've set is a display
[76:14.23]flex align items in the center gap. So
[76:17.52]we have a gap of 10 pixels. You can
[76:19.60]increase the gap here for example 50
[76:21.28]pixels. The title will move
[76:24.56]far apart from the logo. So here the
[76:27.36]title has moved far apart from the from
[76:30.32]the logo. So you can choose whatever
[76:32.48]spacing you you need. In this case we I
[76:34.48]want 10 pixels to gap to put a gap
[76:37.44]between the title and the logo. This
[76:39.60]gap. Okay. This gap is defined by this
[76:42.88]property gap 10 pixels.
[76:46.88]And also the gap property is a new
[76:49.36]attribute come from CSS3. Now let's move
[76:53.36]on to the brand logo. So brand.lo. logo.
[76:56.23]This is the logo element. Let's uh
[76:59.19]define an align size of 36 pixels, block
[77:03.04]size of 36 pixels, 36 pixels, and also
[77:08.48]border- radius. So, let's define the
[77:11.44]radius the radius of the border as 10
[77:14.40]pixels, which is how curved the uh how
[77:18.00]curved are the angles of the border and
[77:20.32]also background. Let's set the
[77:22.08]background as
[77:24.40]URL and I have an image https
[77:28.96]www.programming
[77:32.23]or without uh www. So we can use here
[77:36.71]programming ocean.com/codeeditors
[77:42.56]editors slash new logo.png
[77:46.96]and let's put in here center. So let's
[77:49.76]center the logo slashco cover
[77:53.92]no repeat. Okay. So let's now reload the
[77:58.88]page. And you can see we have the logo
[78:01.04]here. So uh here I have some notes to
[78:05.19]discuss first. If you don't specify
[78:07.52]these two these attributes for example
[78:09.76]if you just leave it as as this
[78:11.92]background URL and then the logo of the
[78:14.80]URL or or the the URL of the logo then
[78:18.96]it will appear like this and you may
[78:20.96]wonder why my logo doesn't show uh
[78:24.48]appropriately or doesn't show in a
[78:26.32]correct mode because you need to center
[78:28.56]the logo center you have to define the
[78:31.04]center so I need to center the logo like
[78:34.71]that and then You may have another
[78:36.80]question. Why does my logo or does my
[78:39.52]image doesn't appear correctly? Well,
[78:42.08]you need to set the cover. So, the logo
[78:45.19]should cover the entire space. The logo
[78:47.76]should cover the entire the entire div.
[78:50.40]Okay. Now, the logo covers that. And
[78:52.96]then let's define sometimes your image
[78:55.76]will be uh too small and it will be
[78:59.52]repeated to cover that. So, let's set
[79:01.04]here no repeat. no repeat to to prevent
[79:04.40]the image from being repeated in case it
[79:06.64]repeats. But now in this case my logo
[79:09.28]does doesn't repeat. So this is my logo
[79:11.67]and you can see so here you pass inside
[79:14.40]the URL function you pass the the URL of
[79:17.36]the logo and here you can specify or
[79:19.76]play around with the border radius. So
[79:22.08]you can put a border radius uh more
[79:24.56]radius value for example 20 pixels and
[79:27.76]you can see now the the the curves here
[79:30.48]will be more curved as you can see now
[79:33.44]we have a a circular type of div okay
[79:37.04]that contains the div. So feel feel free
[79:40.32]to play around with these values. Border
[79:42.48]radius 10 pixels block size also defines
[79:45.84]the the height of the image and align
[79:48.64]size defines the width of the image.
[79:52.08]Let's move on to the title element. So
[79:54.80]title just have a font size of clamp. So
[79:58.32]clamp is a function in CSS which takes
[80:01.44]from me three parameters 18 pixels which
[80:04.56]is the minimum value and then two
[80:07.19]viewport width the preferred value and
[80:09.67]then 22 pixels the maximum value. The
[80:12.71]clamp function will work in a dynamic
[80:15.28]and responsive way. So
[80:18.71]here
[80:22.00]if you go to the page and reload
[80:25.52]okay
[80:27.04]and reload you can see now the title uh
[80:31.12]got larger or becomes larger. Why?
[80:33.44]because the clamp function will
[80:35.36]automatically or let's say automatically
[80:39.52]resize the title depending on the on on
[80:42.40]on these values the minimum value the
[80:45.04]preferred value and the maximum value.
[80:48.00]So the clamp function is considered one
[80:50.23]of those functions
[80:52.32]that really make your title
[80:56.23]responsive and changes its size
[80:58.80]responsively. So clamp in CSS the clamp
[81:01.92]says function is powerful tool is a
[81:04.48]powerful tool for creating responsive
[81:06.80]designs by defining a value that is
[81:09.60]clamped between a minimum. So we have a
[81:12.00]value that is clamped between a minimum
[81:14.48]and a maximum bound. So we have yeah a
[81:16.64]minimum bound and a maximum bound. It
[81:19.19]takes three parameters minimum value the
[81:21.92]lowest allowed value for the property.
[81:24.32]So the lowest allowed value is 18
[81:26.80]pixels. This title will not become
[81:29.76]smaller than 18 pixels whatever
[81:32.48]happened. So in any case it won't become
[81:35.76]smaller than 18 pixels. Then we have
[81:38.64]preferred value. The ideal or desired
[81:41.52]value
[81:43.04]which will be used if if it falls within
[81:45.67]the minimum and maximum bounds. This is
[81:48.15]often a fluid unit like viewport width
[81:51.12]like what we've done here. We have a
[81:53.84]preferred value of two viewport width.
[81:56.88]VW is a unit that is short for viewport
[82:00.40]width. So viewport width or a percentage
[82:04.00]maximum value the last value the highest
[82:06.80]allowed value for the property. Okay. So
[82:09.67]this clamp function works in a dynamic
[82:11.76]mode. And you can see if we go to the
[82:14.15]control shift J and then resize the page
[82:17.28]this title will resize and become larger
[82:21.19]or become smaller depending on the on
[82:23.84]the cloud function. So depending on the
[82:26.08]size. Okay.
[82:29.52]Now let's return back and move on to the
[82:32.48]main section. So now congratulations
[82:35.44]we've finished styling our header. So we
[82:38.63]finished styling our header. Let's move
[82:40.40]on to the main section. So main, let's
[82:43.67]set a maximum width of 1,560 pixels. So
[82:47.52]the maximum width sets the maximum width
[82:49.92]an element can have. And it will prevent
[82:52.40]this element from becoming wider than
[82:55.52]this specified value. And let's set here
[82:58.48]margin- align to margin align as auto.
[83:03.52]Also let's give it a padding of 18
[83:05.52]pixels
[83:07.19]and display as grid. And this is an
[83:10.48]important property. So display grid is a
[83:13.36]new display that has been introduced
[83:16.80]with CSS3. Display grid as we said as
[83:20.96]flexbox is suitable for one-dimensional
[83:23.84]layouts. Grid is suitable suitable for
[83:29.60]designing
[83:31.36]for designing and structuring
[83:35.28]structuring
[83:37.76]2D layouts layouts in CSS. So if you
[83:42.80]want to create a 2D layout structure
[83:45.84]like for example cards or uh a grid like
[83:49.19]structure a grid like layout you can use
[83:52.00]display grid and then set this nice and
[83:55.12]powerful property which is grid-template
[83:58.40]dash columns. So this is a really
[84:01.04]powerful property that sets the template
[84:03.92]columns for a grid layout structure.
[84:07.12]Let's set here 280 pixels, one fraction
[84:10.32]and then 360 pixels. And now let's set a
[84:14.23]gap of variable gap.
[84:17.04]Here I want to emphasize on this thing.
[84:19.92]Now we have this display grid. And you
[84:22.80]may wonder uh display grid. What does
[84:25.12]the what is the purpose of display grid?
[84:27.52]Well, let's go and give each of our
[84:31.04]elements here. Let's go to the aside
[84:35.04]element. We have aside and we have
[84:36.48]section and we have the the second
[84:38.32]aside. So we have a side element then we
[84:40.71]have a section element then we have this
[84:42.40]aside element. Okay. And now we have set
[84:44.63]to the main that we want a maximum width
[84:47.12]of 1,516
[84:49.04]pixels. If we put a background red for
[84:52.80]this element aside and this element
[84:55.44]specify it as background for example
[84:57.60]blue. Okay. And this element as
[84:59.84]background yellow just to distinguish
[85:01.92]them. Now we have three elements, three
[85:04.40]sub sections within the main element.
[85:07.76]Okay, the main element has a display
[85:10.80]grid. Okay, grid.
[85:14.40]You can see now each of these elements
[85:16.32]now has has been rearranged to be in a
[85:20.15]grid mode to be in a grid layout. Now
[85:22.56]let's set some backgrounds to to to
[85:27.36]make this idea clear. the aside. Let's
[85:29.92]give it a background of blue. Let's give
[85:32.56]a background for example for this
[85:34.08]element the section give it a background
[85:36.32]as yellow background yellow. And let's
[85:39.92]specify a background for this aside like
[85:43.28]for example white. Now as you can see we
[85:46.23]have three subsections inside this main
[85:50.80]element and each section has a has a
[85:54.23]width of these values. So the first
[85:57.12]section has a has a width of 280 pixels.
[86:01.12]As you can see, this element has a width
[86:03.19]of 280 pixels. This element, the second
[86:06.71]element has a width of one fraction. And
[86:09.28]the fraction is a is a percentage value
[86:13.60]that or or is a rational value that
[86:16.88]gives this element a rational width.
[86:20.08]Meaning uh the rest of the width of the
[86:22.88]element that has been that has been
[86:26.15]available. It will set the width this
[86:28.63]the width of this element to have a
[86:31.28]width of the available space of the of
[86:33.76]the available remaining space. And this
[86:36.00]element will have a width of this 360
[86:39.12]pixels. So the pixels are hardcoded
[86:41.84]units. Pixels are fixed units. When you
[86:45.84]set for for a section a a unit with a
[86:48.71]pixel then this section will have the
[86:51.04]same
[86:52.56]set value for these pixels. But when you
[86:55.44]give an element a fraction unit then
[86:58.00]this element becomes dynamic and becomes
[87:00.56]flexible and it will adjust depending on
[87:03.44]the available remaining space. Okay. So
[87:07.28]uh if you want to understand grid
[87:09.52]template grid template columns you can
[87:12.56]play around with those values. Okay. So
[87:15.67]in in essence grid template
[87:19.92]columns in CSS property defines the
[87:22.23]number and widths of columns in a CSS
[87:24.88]grid layout. So here you can see how
[87:27.60]many columns we have. We have three
[87:29.76]columns 1 2 3. So when you specify here
[87:33.92]three values it will define the number
[87:36.40]of columns. Now you can see here we have
[87:38.48]one two three. we have three columns and
[87:41.44]also
[87:43.76]uh it defines the number and widths of
[87:46.63]columns in a CSS grid layout. It is
[87:48.71]applied to the grid container element.
[87:50.88]The grid template columns property
[87:52.80]accepts a space separated list. So it
[87:55.84]takes here a a space separated list of
[87:59.60]values and these values where each value
[88:03.12]represents the size of a column. Each
[88:05.60]value from these values represents the
[88:07.76]size, the width of each column. Common
[88:10.56]values include pixels, em for emphasize
[88:15.12]and also viewport width, viewport height
[88:17.52]and also it could be fractions. And here
[88:20.23]you can see the fraction unit which is
[88:22.96]flexible units. We have fraction FR. The
[88:26.23]FR unit represents a fraction of the
[88:28.88]available space in the grid container.
[88:31.60]Okay. So you can play around with these
[88:33.28]values if you want to know more. For
[88:35.12]example, let's set here one fraction and
[88:37.36]this is one fraction just to uh make
[88:40.00]this idea clear. And here you can see
[88:42.96]now we have if we give it give this
[88:45.60]background of yellow for example and
[88:47.92]give this element a background of
[88:53.36]background color of red.
[88:56.71]You can see what is what has happened.
[88:58.71]Now we have an equally sized width
[89:04.23]element. So these elements have an equal
[89:06.48]size. Why? Because every single column
[89:09.60]has a width of one fraction, one
[89:11.76]fraction, one fraction. So it will be
[89:14.32]arranged and it will be distributed. The
[89:16.96]width will be distributed over these
[89:18.80]three columns. Okay? Equally it will be
[89:21.44]distributed equally. But when you
[89:23.04]specify for example this column has a
[89:25.19]280 pixels this column has a 360 pixels
[89:28.96]then each column will have the same
[89:31.28]number of pixels specifi number of
[89:33.12]pixels specified for it but this element
[89:35.76]or this section will have a fractional
[89:38.15]or rational value that will depend on
[89:40.56]the available remaining space
[89:43.92]like that. So this is an important idea.
[89:46.88]Here we have you can see we have this
[89:49.12]panel which is a lower width sized
[89:52.15]element and here we have this section
[89:54.48]which is you can see one fraction and
[89:56.96]here we have this element as wider than
[89:59.28]this element. So the third column is
[90:02.00]wider than the first column because why
[90:04.56]we have set 360 pixels. So you can play
[90:07.84]around or feel free to play around with
[90:10.15]the display grid and change these values
[90:12.56]to no more. And the gap also you can
[90:14.88]play around the gap. Recall that the gap
[90:16.71]variable is set to have a amount of 14
[90:20.15]pixels. If we increase that gap and make
[90:22.96]it here for example 50 pixels. You can
[90:26.88]see now if you go to this now we have a
[90:29.44]gap of 50 pixels. So let's return back
[90:33.36]and move on to the next element media.
[90:36.23]So we need a media query to make our
[90:39.36]design responsive and fully working for
[90:42.40]every single device. Maximum width as
[90:46.23]100 1,100
[90:48.80]pixels. So let's set the maximum width
[90:51.19]of the media as 1,100 pixels. Then let's
[90:54.80]choose the main element or select the
[90:57.04]main element and give it a
[90:58.71]grid-template-c columns to have another
[91:02.08]set of widths other than this list of
[91:04.63]widths which is one fraction. And if you
[91:07.28]don't repeat that it will uh it will
[91:10.23]generalize this value over all columns.
[91:12.96]It will provide every single column with
[91:15.84]this value one fraction. Now let's
[91:18.48]return back and when we do a media query
[91:21.67]here, note here the maximum width is
[91:25.04]1,100 pixels. Let's get a size of this
[91:29.60]1,100 pixels.
[91:33.92]This size let's make the screen lower or
[91:37.67]smaller. You can see now these elements.
[91:40.80]Okay, like that. Okay, a display in a
[91:45.04]mobile friendly way rather than this it
[91:48.40]becomes like this. Okay, so one fraction
[91:51.28]having a full width. Every element have
[91:54.15]has a full width. The available full
[91:56.63]width.
[92:01.36]Now let's go to the card element
[92:05.44]or let's style the card element. Recall
[92:08.48]which elements has the card class to be
[92:11.52]aware. Here we have this element aside
[92:14.80]element has a class of card. So the
[92:17.36]first aside element has a class of card
[92:20.32]and also inside the the middle section
[92:23.28]the middle section we have a div here
[92:26.40]which has a class of cart. Okay. And
[92:29.44]also we have another assignite element
[92:31.60]with the class card which is the third
[92:33.67]and the last column here. So all of
[92:35.84]these are cards. Here we have this card.
[92:38.08]Here we have a card and also here we
[92:40.23]have a card like element. Let's style
[92:42.56]these elements and give them the
[92:44.40]following styles.
[92:46.56]Background. Let's set a background of
[92:49.12]linear-gradient.
[92:50.71]I like setting backgrounds as linear
[92:53.04]gradients. And let's specify here 180°
[92:57.44]RGBA. Specify here 255 255 255. So if
[93:02.08]you if you if you specify the red
[93:03.92]channel, green channel, blue channel,
[93:05.84]all of these channels, if you specify
[93:07.36]them as 255, 255, 255, then it will
[93:10.23]become white, a clear white element. And
[93:13.76]then we can manipulate this white by
[93:16.63]reducing or inc or increasing the alpha
[93:19.36]value, which is the opacity of the
[93:21.12]color. In this case, we need to make it
[93:23.28]0.05
[93:25.12]to make this color darker. And let's set
[93:28.63]a RGBA color which has a 255 255 255.
[93:33.52]And let's manipulate the alpha value the
[93:35.84]opacity to have a 0.03.
[93:38.63]So also a darker value or a dark value.
[93:42.23]Here you can see the backgrounds now are
[93:45.19]dark.
[93:46.71]Here I think we have linear gradient.
[93:50.56]You can see now the backgrounds are
[93:52.56]changed to this value. So you can feel
[93:55.28]free to manipulate this color to
[93:57.04]whatever you want. Now let's go to the
[93:59.12]border. Let's give them a border. Why?
[94:01.52]Because the border sets the outer the
[94:04.40]outer kind of border or the boundaries
[94:06.80]of the elements to make them separate or
[94:09.12]to make the element uh go prominent to
[94:12.88]make the element become prominent. So
[94:15.04]border of one pixel solid and then rgba
[94:18.32]color of 255 255 255 and the alpha value
[94:22.08]as 0.1. You can see now it will it will
[94:25.67]have some borders here. You can see now
[94:27.60]we have some borders. The border
[94:29.84]distinguishes the element, makes the
[94:32.23]element feel live. And next let's go
[94:36.32]border dash radius to have a variable of
[94:39.67]the radius value.
[94:42.23]And let's set a box shadow
[94:46.23]of zero and then 10 pixels, 30 pixels
[94:50.23]and also RGBA of 0 0 comma 25.
[94:55.84]Okay, let's now see the magic. You can
[94:59.44]see now we have a radius border. So the
[95:03.76]curves now are are curved and also we
[95:07.12]have a box shadow. If we if we go to the
[95:09.76]console here, so control shift J, we can
[95:13.04]manipulate the shadow as we want. Let's
[95:16.00]go to the to this element section. For
[95:18.48]example, here we have the shadow
[95:20.32]element.
[95:21.92]If you go to the stack here,
[95:26.96]here the shadow you can move the 10
[95:29.19]pixels. Here you can increase it. You
[95:31.76]can also
[95:33.92]do like that. And you can change the
[95:36.00]color if you want. for example, make the
[95:37.76]color red or for example having some
[95:41.28]yellow shadow or any other color. So
[95:45.04]feel free to play around with these
[95:46.71]values as you want. But in this case,
[95:48.88]let's keep it realistic and keep the
[95:51.28]shadows
[95:53.12]lighter. Let's move on to the panel
[95:57.19]element and give it a padding of 16
[96:00.23]pixels.
[96:01.92]So the padding sets the inner spacing or
[96:04.80]the inter spacing of the element as 16
[96:08.23]pixels to add some spacing. You can see
[96:11.19]now here we don't have any paddings but
[96:13.84]now we do have some padding. So, so the
[96:16.23]inter spacing the spacing inside the
[96:18.71]element between the element and its
[96:21.28]childs
[96:23.60]and also if if you want to know which
[96:25.52]elements have the have have the panel
[96:27.36]here we have a an aside element with the
[96:30.23]panel class and also here we have a div
[96:32.48]element with the panel class and also an
[96:35.04]aside with a class of panel. So every
[96:37.19]single element we are selecting here by
[96:39.76]the panel class. So we are choosing
[96:41.67]every single element with the panel
[96:43.52]class and giving them a padding of this
[96:46.15]desired amount. Let's move on to the
[96:48.15]muted or the H2, H3 elements and give
[96:52.40]them a margin because recall we've reset
[96:55.44]the margins here in the asterisk. We've
[96:57.84]reset them to back to zero. So we need
[96:59.92]to add now some margins manually by
[97:02.71]going 0 0 but from 12 pixels. Okay. So a
[97:07.36]margin value of 0 0 12 pixels. You can
[97:10.63]see now these H2s and H3s element will
[97:14.71]have a margin from where? From the
[97:16.88]bottom side because here we have this is
[97:19.36]the top side. Okay. Uh this is the top
[97:23.36]side, the right side, the bottom side
[97:25.76]and this is the left side. And if you
[97:27.92]want to play around these values, you
[97:29.60]can go here and change these values to
[97:33.19]whatever you want. So here if you here
[97:36.00]we have the top margin. You can see the
[97:38.56]top and here we have the right margin
[97:41.60]the right and also here we have the
[97:43.76]bottom margin you can see the bottom and
[97:46.23]also we can manipulate the left margin
[97:48.56]by going for example like this you can
[97:50.63]see the left
[97:53.44]but let's keep them real realistic 002
[97:57.04]pixels. Now let's move on to the muted
[97:59.19]element. So the muted element let's set
[98:01.52]a color of variable muted which we've
[98:03.84]set earlier and font size to have a font
[98:07.28]size of 13 pixels. Now recall the muted
[98:11.92]elements are these elements the tip
[98:13.92]which is control plus s to save and also
[98:16.48]these two list. Okay now we have these
[98:19.84]two elements styled. How? By setting a
[98:23.60]color of the muted recall the muted
[98:25.84]color here muted color which is this
[98:28.32]grayish color 8B 93 A7 this gray color
[98:32.56]and also we've given them a font size of
[98:35.04]13 pixels which made them smaller lower
[98:38.48]in size.
[98:40.56]Now let's move on to the stack element
[98:42.56]which is an important element stack.
[98:44.40]Recall which elements have the stack
[98:46.15]class. This assignite element have the
[98:48.48]stack class. Also this section have a
[98:51.36]class of stack and also the aside
[98:53.84]element have a class of st of stack. So
[98:56.63]whichever element that have a class of
[98:59.19]stack or that has that has a class of
[99:01.92]stack we need to set the following
[99:04.63]display as flex and then flex direction.
[99:09.11]So the direction of the flex could be
[99:11.28]row or it could be column. In this case
[99:13.92]I have a question stack. What does stack
[99:16.56]mean? mean it will be displayed or
[99:18.71]arranged the items will be arranged in a
[99:21.11]stack manner in a stack way which means
[99:24.00]we we will have to set the flex
[99:25.76]direction into a column value. So thus
[99:28.96]the flex direction should be column
[99:32.48]and then let's set a gap of 10 pixels.
[99:35.67]Now note with me the magic happening
[99:38.00]here.
[99:40.23]So all of these elements are now
[99:42.08]arranged in a proper way. Why? because
[99:44.71]they have this stack class and we've
[99:47.28]selected them by using dot recall dot
[99:49.92]selects a class. So dot stack and then
[99:52.32]set the display as flex flex direction
[99:55.84]as column. The flex direction property
[99:58.56]sets the direction of the flex. So
[100:01.92]basically the flex direction column in
[100:05.60]CSS this property in CSS
[100:09.92]flex direction property defines how flex
[100:12.80]items are placed within a flex
[100:15.44]container. It establishes the main axis.
[100:18.32]So it establishes the main axis whether
[100:20.48]it is a row axis or a column axis and
[100:23.11]the direction normal or or reversed
[100:25.92]along which the items are arranged. This
[100:28.23]property is applied to the fixed
[100:30.08]container. So here we have stack is a
[100:32.80]flex container. The the display is set
[100:35.76]as flex. The parent element with display
[100:38.80]flex or display in line flex and the
[100:41.84]values could be row. So the default if
[100:44.40]we don't set this property by default
[100:47.11]any element that have a display flex it
[100:49.76]will be it will be display as row. So
[100:52.15]you can see row but once we
[100:56.23]set the flex direction property as
[100:59.19]column it will be column rather than the
[101:02.08]default rather than the default which is
[101:04.80]row. So now we have row elements note
[101:07.52]row manner. Let's set them let's set
[101:09.52]them to column. Now we have them in a
[101:12.08]column manner in a column way. Why?
[101:14.56]Because we have flex dash direction set
[101:17.19]to column. Really important property.
[101:21.67]And the next value is is also column.
[101:24.80]Column flex items are arranged
[101:26.80]vertically
[101:28.32]from top to bottom. The main axis is
[101:30.48]vertical. And also for row and column,
[101:33.92]we have two properties which are
[101:35.67]reverse. So you can set column reverse
[101:38.32]or row reverse. Row reverse flex items
[101:41.60]are arranged horizontally from right to
[101:43.92]left in a left to right language. The
[101:46.63]main axis is horizontal but the start
[101:49.04]and and end lines are reversed.
[101:53.04]So you can see now if you set them like
[101:55.11]that these items will be flipped. So you
[101:58.56]can see these items are what are flipped
[102:01.28]the other way around because we've set
[102:03.19]them uh column reverse also. If you if
[102:06.08]if we do row like that note we have them
[102:09.60]in this order. We can do row reverse.
[102:13.11]So these are all these are all the
[102:15.19]variations of the values. So here you
[102:17.76]can see we have row row reverse column
[102:20.96]column reverse. Okay. Now they are
[102:23.76]flipped the other way around. But the
[102:26.23]ideal value here is column. Let's move
[102:28.63]on to the next element after stack which
[102:32.32]is row dot row. So row has a display
[102:36.88]flex. So a flexbox or a flexible box
[102:40.96]module layout in CSS. And then let's
[102:44.00]assign the align dash items. So the
[102:46.71]alignment of the items as center. We
[102:49.04]need to center them and the gap as 10
[102:51.28]pixels. 10 pixels. And let's set here
[102:54.88]the flex wrap as wrap. The flex wrap
[102:58.23]wrap will wrap the elements will make
[103:00.71]the elements wrap meaning go bottom go
[103:04.15]to the next line. When the page is
[103:06.15]resized, it makes our designs and our
[103:09.36]layouts more responsive and mobile
[103:11.92]friendly. And let's go into justify dash
[103:14.80]content and set it as spec space between
[103:17.76]and set it as space between. So
[103:20.56]essentially whichever element here that
[103:23.60]has a class of row recall inside the
[103:26.40]header element we have a div with the
[103:28.63]class container and also row. And also
[103:31.36]inside this container we have another
[103:33.44]nice div with a class row. And here also
[103:36.96]inside the I think this div we have div
[103:40.56]class row and then we have div class row
[103:42.88]which contains the buttons which is run
[103:45.36]and open preview in a new window. These
[103:47.92]all elements row row row will have this
[103:50.88]the next following style styles as you
[103:54.71]can see.
[103:56.88]Let's comment it to see the effect.
[104:00.56]Okay. So now these elements no notice
[104:05.11]they don't have any uh display flex and
[104:08.48]then the row doesn't appear like in like
[104:11.52]a row element. Uh these elements are not
[104:14.15]in a row mode once we specify these
[104:17.60]display flex and then what is the flex
[104:20.71]direction value here? By default it is
[104:23.84]row. So we don't have to set it. You
[104:26.48]don't necessarily have to set flex
[104:29.11]direction to row but if you want that's
[104:31.60]basically that's totally fine and it
[104:34.40]will appear like that. So these buttons
[104:36.15]now are in in a row mode. These two
[104:38.48]buttons and these two buttons. So these
[104:41.60]containers now are in a row mode or in
[104:45.44]in a row specific uh row way. Let's move
[104:48.71]on to the next element which is btn. Now
[104:51.19]btn is a beautiful element. Appearance
[104:55.19]as none. Let's set the appearance as
[104:57.36]none. Look this is an this is a nice and
[105:00.48]magnificent property. Appearance none.
[105:02.71]You can see now these buttons will have
[105:04.88]the effect of none. Like that. So the
[105:08.56]appearance is now none. You can see the
[105:11.04]appearance now has become none. And the
[105:13.76]next is border none. Let's set a border
[105:16.63]of none. So let's get rid of the border.
[105:19.11]Here we have these borders. Now we don't
[105:21.67]have borders anymore. And let's set a
[105:24.88]background of linear dash gradient
[105:29.67]180° and a variable of brand color brand
[105:34.63]two and also let's set a color of the
[105:37.11]variable uh brand. Okay, like that. So
[105:40.71]we have background as linear gradient
[105:43.36]which has a 180° the first color brand
[105:47.36]two the second color brand. You can see
[105:50.48]now the backgrounds of the buttons. If
[105:52.63]you reload the page now we have this is
[105:55.11]the background of the buttons changed.
[105:58.48]Let's go ahead and set the color as 081
[106:04.15]onef. So here you can see the color is
[106:08.08]like that. And let's go ahead and set
[106:11.11]the font weight as 700 to be bolder. So
[106:14.71]the weight so the font will be waiter.
[106:17.52]You can see it becomes bold. Uh bolder
[106:20.08]or waiter 700 and padding let's set it
[106:23.60]as
[106:25.11]10 pixels and then 14 pixels.
[106:28.88]I also has give it a border radius of 12
[106:31.84]pixels. You can play around with that
[106:33.84]feel free. And then the cursor as
[106:36.23]pointer. This is an important property.
[106:38.96]And now note the cursor isn't pointer.
[106:41.60]When we when we hover over the buttons,
[106:43.92]the cursor doesn't change into a pointer
[106:46.63]like cursor. If you search here, pointer
[106:50.32]cursor
[106:51.92]images.
[106:53.60]This is the pointer. Uh this is the
[106:55.44]pointer kind of uh this is the pointer
[106:57.11]cursor and this is the arrow. So now
[106:59.76]currently when we hover over the button,
[107:02.40]it doesn't change. We need to change it
[107:04.32]into cursor pointer. And then let's
[107:06.63]specify a box shadow of 0 10 pixels and
[107:11.36]then 24 pixels 24 pixels and RGBA of 96
[107:16.71]comma 165 comma 250 comma 0.25.
[107:21.60]Now note what will happen here and also
[107:25.11]the alpha value here as 0
[107:28.88]let's make it 35 for example. You can
[107:31.52]play around with that.
[107:33.84]Now these are the buttons of our app.
[107:36.23]Okay, you can see we have all these
[107:38.71]buttons as the following
[107:43.28]here. The padding is 10 pixels, 40
[107:45.36]pixels. You can play around with the
[107:46.56]padding and also the border radius as 12
[107:48.88]pixels, cursor pointer and the box
[107:51.19]shadow. Feel free to to play with that.
[107:54.15]Let's move on to the next element. Btn
[107:56.80]secondary. So which buttons have the
[107:59.28]secondary class? If you recall these
[108:02.15]buttons have the secondary class. Here
[108:05.28]inside this header we have a button with
[108:08.40]a class btn and also secondary which is
[108:11.04]the save and load bns. The two buttons
[108:13.44]for save and load in the header. So in
[108:16.15]the header the save and load buttons
[108:18.71]have the secondary class. Note what
[108:21.28]would happen to them. First we need to
[108:23.84]set background of transparent. So give
[108:27.84]them a background transparent and then
[108:30.40]border let's set it as one pixel solid
[108:34.40]and give it a RGBA color of 255 255 255,
[108:39.76]0.15 and also let's go to the color and
[108:42.96]set the color as as the variable txt and
[108:46.56]also box shadow give it as none. So we
[108:50.56]don't need a box shadow element or box
[108:53.04]shadow effect. You can see here we have
[108:55.11]this box shadow the the color the shades
[108:58.08]of the button now will disappear. Okay.
[109:00.96]So three two one this what has be this
[109:05.04]the this is the the new look of the
[109:07.60]buttons. You can see they now have a
[109:09.84]background of transparent. So they do
[109:12.23]not have any background border as one
[109:14.80]pixel solid and this color and also a
[109:17.60]color of the variable txt. Recall txt is
[109:20.96]this color. this whiter color E9 ECF1
[109:24.88]and also it has a box shadow of none. So
[109:28.00]we've reset the box shadow to be zero to
[109:30.48]be nothing to disappear.
[109:33.52]Now let's go onto onto the btn warn the
[109:38.15]warning button which is one button just
[109:41.11]just one button this button run with
[109:43.60]tests this button has a class of warn if
[109:47.36]if we search here warn
[109:49.84]button class btn warn that is uh the
[109:53.28]button that contains the text run with
[109:56.15]tests so the button with the with the
[109:58.48]text run with tests this button let's
[110:01.84]style it and give it some style styling
[110:03.76]as the following background just a
[110:06.40]background property linear-gradient
[110:09.52]set a linear gradient color to be 180°
[110:14.15]so the movement of the gradient is 180°
[110:17.19]and then let's give it a orange color of
[110:20.32]F5 9 F5 9E 0 B comma E A B308
[110:28.08]okay so these two colors now let's see
[110:31.11]what happen what would happen this for
[110:33.44]this button this button run with tests
[110:37.60]you can see we've changed the color of
[110:39.52]it okay let's move on to the bit okay so
[110:43.92]guess which button of these buttons are
[110:46.40]the okay button this button uh this
[110:49.19]button run okay background
[110:53.19]linear-gradient
[110:55.36]give it a 180° uh movement the movement
[110:58.56]of the gradient and then specify three 4
[111:03.67]D39
[111:05.67]this this color which is the greenish
[111:07.76]color and then hash 22
[111:11.19]C 55E. So these two colors would give us
[111:16.40]the effect of the okay button here. This
[111:19.67]button is the okay button. The button
[111:21.67]with the okay class. And you can see now
[111:24.15]it has the green color. Okay. So we are
[111:27.19]slowly building our page. Let's move on
[111:30.48]to the se the btn error dotbtn the
[111:35.44]button with the error class and specify
[111:38.96]a background of the following linear
[111:41.92]dash gradient to have a 180°. So 180° de
[111:47.28]eg short for degrees and then specify
[111:49.92]the next color FB
[111:52.63]7
[111:55.36]85 comma and then E E F 4444
[112:01.84]okay these two colors let's specify it
[112:05.44]and run the page so uh this is the I
[112:08.88]think
[112:11.44]I think we don't have this this button
[112:13.44]which is the error button error
[112:15.52]But if we given this class for example
[112:17.67]to the clear log button for example here
[112:21.04]make it error. Now you would see this
[112:23.67]button becomes an error button clear
[112:26.08]log. Okay
[112:28.63]let's move on to the next styling which
[112:30.63]is the dot select comma select the
[112:35.19]select element.ext text and let's go
[112:38.88]ahead and do a background uh give it a
[112:42.08]background color of RGBA 255 255 255
[112:46.71]comma 0.03 03 and then let's specify a
[112:49.84]border of one pixel solid. So the
[112:52.23]thickness is one pixel. The type of the
[112:54.00]color is the type of the border is solid
[112:56.32]rgba as 255 255 255, 0.12. Also let's
[113:02.48]set a color to use the variable
[113:06.15]txt
[113:08.08]and a padding of 10 pixels 12 pixels.
[113:11.92]give it some inner spacing and border-
[113:14.40]radius which spec which specifies the
[113:17.19]radius of the borders as 12 pixels.
[113:22.00]You can see now the txt. Now which
[113:25.11]elements have the text class recall that
[113:28.32]we've set for the text area element here
[113:31.44]text area inside the aside we have a
[113:34.80]text area element with a class text. So
[113:37.67]the class text here dot text and also we
[113:40.88]have this text area element with the
[113:43.04]class text okay if you note them here
[113:46.88]these two text area elements let's run
[113:50.23]they have become like that okay so if
[113:53.36]you want to to know how we did that for
[113:55.67]example the background the border the
[113:58.63]color padding border radius you can play
[114:02.15]around with them and choose whichever
[114:05.04]values you would like to use But here I
[114:07.84]have set the padding as 10 pixels 12
[114:09.92]pixels. Now note if you change this to
[114:11.84]20 pixels it will become like that. So
[114:15.52]it will become uh more heighter. The
[114:19.04]height will increase the height will
[114:21.59]increase. And also if you set the 12
[114:24.15]pixels for example 20 pixels increase it
[114:27.36]from 12 to 20 it will become like that.
[114:31.44]So the text will not start from the
[114:34.23]starting but will have some padding then
[114:37.19]it will start from here. Okay. So rather
[114:39.76]than starting start writing from the
[114:41.92]beginning it will start writing from the
[114:45.52]the space that was uh spaced off by the
[114:49.52]uh value specified by the padding which
[114:52.40]is 12 pixels.
[114:54.96]Let's move on to the next element which
[114:57.28]is now we need to to se to select the
[115:00.32]text area
[115:02.63]dot text and give it a width of 100%.
[115:06.80]Then give it a a minimum height minimum
[115:09.52]dash height of 120 pixels. So the
[115:12.71]minimum height is an important and
[115:14.71]significant property in CSS. The minimum
[115:17.28]height sets the lowest possible allowed
[115:21.19]height for the element. the element will
[115:23.67]not exceed won't exceed this height
[115:26.80]which is 18 120 pixels. Now you can see
[115:30.88]here
[115:33.44]they become the length have increased.
[115:36.15]Why? Because we have set the minimum
[115:38.32]height to be 120 pixels. If you increase
[115:41.92]it to for example 200 pixels 200 pixels
[115:46.00]then it will become the length will
[115:48.32]increase. Okay, the length will increase
[115:51.59]and it will uh contain or it will it
[115:54.63]will be it will be enough for more text.
[115:57.04]It will show more text. But here let's
[115:59.76]set it to a reasonable value like 120
[116:03.11]pixels.
[116:04.71]And the next element let's go to the
[116:06.88]tabs element. So the tabs elements which
[116:09.44]is the the div that contains the tabs
[116:11.67]these tabs HTML CSS JavaScript and
[116:14.80]design it to have a display of flex as
[116:18.88]we said display flex is a new way to
[116:22.32]style the layouts of the modules in CSS
[116:25.36]and it has been introduced in CSS3 gap
[116:28.48]of 10 of 8 pixels and let's set a flex
[116:32.08]wrap wrap. So wrap will wrap the
[116:35.11]elements if the page becomes smaller and
[116:37.59]it will make the design mobile friendly.
[116:41.36]You can see now we've styled the parent
[116:44.48]to have a display flex and a gap of 8
[116:47.19]pixels. Now let's move on to the dot tab
[116:49.44]element and give it the next styles
[116:52.63]padding. Now we can do this actually in
[116:54.88]the console to see it. Okay. So let's
[116:59.28]give it a padding of 8 pixels
[117:02.71]and then 12 pixels. 12 pixels. And also
[117:07.19]let's set a border dash radius of 10
[117:10.00]pixels. You can see now it has a border
[117:12.56]radius of 10 pixels. And then border
[117:15.67]as one pixel. So the the thickness one
[117:18.88]pixel. And then the type of the border
[117:20.88]is solid RGBA 255 255 255, 0.14. Then
[117:27.84]let's set a background color of RGBA and
[117:31.67]set it as 255 255 255 comma 0.03.
[117:36.48]Let's set a cursor as pointer. The
[117:39.52]cursor cursor property or attribute as
[117:42.71]pointer. So now when you hover over the
[117:45.11]element the cursor becomes
[117:48.56]pointer. And now let's move on to the
[117:50.88]font weight element uh font weight
[117:53.44]property and set it as 700. set it as
[117:56.56]700 and also the color to have a color
[117:59.28]of F FFF or white you can say right now
[118:04.08]you can see we have all these styles and
[118:07.19]the padding note without padding the
[118:09.76]element will won't have an inner spacing
[118:12.56]but with padding now we have inner
[118:14.15]spacing the border radius it becomes the
[118:17.19]uh it converts the border into a curved
[118:20.23]angles you can see into curved angles
[118:22.96]you can increase that if you want Okay,
[118:26.00]but let's keep it 10 pixels. And also
[118:28.96]the border, if you don't specify a
[118:31.44]border, it will become a groovy border.
[118:33.59]But if you specify it as solid, it will
[118:35.44]become like this border. Also the
[118:37.52]cursor, if you don't specify cursor, we
[118:39.67]won't have this nice effect of the
[118:41.67]cursor. And also the same for font
[118:44.48]weight. If you want to convert the font
[118:47.19]into a weight style or into a bolder
[118:49.52]style, you can set font weight as 700 or
[118:52.23]even 900 or even bolder. So, it's a
[118:56.32]bolder value, but let's keep it as 700.
[118:59.36]Let's copy all of these styles and paste
[119:02.48]them right within the tab element.
[119:06.08]And by doing so, by refreshing the page,
[119:12.08]all of these tabs now become styled. So
[119:15.28]we are slowly and gradually designing
[119:18.08]and building our web page, structuring
[119:20.48]our web page as you can see. Now let's
[119:22.80]move on to the dot tab.active. So what
[119:25.84]would happen to the active tab
[119:27.84]background? give it a background of
[119:30.32]linear dash gradient to have a 180
[119:33.36]degrees, RGBA and then 125 comma 211. So
[119:39.92]211 for the green channel and 252 for
[119:43.59]the blue channel and set a 0.18 for the
[119:46.63]alpha channel. Then let's give it
[119:48.56]another color RGBA of 96 comma 165 comma
[119:54.56]250 comma 0.18.
[119:58.23]And let's move on to the next property
[120:00.15]which is color. Set a color to have a
[120:03.11]zero zero f uh 00 f then f 0 0
[120:09.52]important.
[120:12.00]So the active element will have a
[120:14.40]background and color of these two
[120:16.23]colors. If you refresh now the default
[120:19.19]element now currently the default tab is
[120:22.96]what here we have button class tab
[120:26.08]active which is the HTML tab. So the
[120:29.28]HTML tab this button button element has
[120:33.04]a class of tab and also active. So it
[120:36.00]will have the applied CSS for the for
[120:39.04]the active tab. Okay. If you provide the
[120:43.52]the rest of these for example active if
[120:46.32]we give if you provide the CSS with
[120:48.23]active now note the CSS will be also
[120:51.36]active
[120:52.88]and also if we provide the JS with the
[120:55.36]active tab with the active class so here
[120:58.23]the class set it as tab active it will
[121:01.36]activate the JavaScript tab but
[121:04.08]currently we do we don't want this
[121:05.67]behavior we just need the HTML tab to be
[121:08.96]active okay just need the HTML type to
[121:12.23]be active alone only the HTML.
[121:16.15]Feel free to play around with this
[121:17.36]value. For example, if you want it if
[121:19.44]you want it to be for example a red
[121:21.44]channel or red uh red value like this
[121:25.28]HTML but I want I want to keep it as
[121:29.44]green color.
[121:31.84]Let's move on to the next which is dot
[121:33.84]editor ra the editor wrap element.
[121:37.19]Recall we here we have these div
[121:39.84]elements div class editor wrap div class
[121:43.19]editor wrap div class editor wrap. These
[121:45.76]three divs have a class of editor wrap.
[121:48.56]So we want to give them the following
[121:50.23]styles. Position relative. Now what does
[121:53.76]a position relative mean in CSS? Well,
[121:56.80]basically position relative in CSS mean
[122:00.96]that the element will be positioned
[122:04.00]relatively relatively
[122:07.36]to uh in terms of the page. So position
[122:12.08]relative in CSS
[122:15.04]mean that the element will be positioned
[122:17.28]relatively
[122:19.84]in the page. You can see here the
[122:22.40]position relative property in CSS allows
[122:25.59]an element to be positioned relative to
[122:28.08]its normal position in the document
[122:30.08]flow. This means that the elements
[122:32.63]original space in the layout is
[122:34.80]preserved but the element itself can be
[122:37.92]shifted from that original position
[122:40.23]using the top right bottom and left
[122:42.00]properties. So if you specify position
[122:44.08]relative, you would see that this
[122:46.40]element will be positioned relatively
[122:49.36]and we can move it using the top
[122:53.67]left
[122:55.84]right properties. So if you want to move
[122:59.59]it, you can use these four properties to
[123:02.40]move and play around and manipulate the
[123:05.11]editor ra. If you go to the editor here,
[123:08.80]element editor wrap and also give it a
[123:12.56]background of blue.
[123:15.19]Okay, this element uh if it appears now
[123:18.40]after after now when we specify the
[123:20.56]following the following properties. We
[123:23.59]can play around and manipulate to this
[123:25.84]element by using the top left right
[123:28.15]properties. Why? because of set the
[123:30.40]position to relative and and it will
[123:32.96]have a relative position in terms of the
[123:36.15]surrounding elements.
[123:40.15]So let's move on to the border and give
[123:43.11]it a 1 pixel solid RGBA of 255 255 255
[123:48.08]comma 0.12 the opacity color and set a
[123:51.67]border dash radius of 14 pixels
[123:56.71]and the overflow property as hidden.
[123:58.96]Let's set the overflow as hidden. The
[124:00.96]overflow property uh controls the fluid
[124:04.23]content of the element. If the content
[124:07.44]exceeds the parent element, then what
[124:10.48]should happen to that content? Should it
[124:12.40]be visible or hidden? In this case, we
[124:15.44]want to to make it hidden or to specify
[124:18.23]the overflowity of the element to be
[124:21.04]hidden. Then minimum height, set it as
[124:24.48]280 pixels. So the minimum height will
[124:28.15]display the element. Before when we
[124:30.88]change the background here, it doesn't
[124:32.71]show because it doesn't have any height.
[124:34.88]Now we've specified we've specified a
[124:37.11]minimum height. Now that we've specified
[124:39.59]the minimum height, we can show the
[124:41.36]element and give it a background and
[124:43.19]show it.
[124:45.19]Let's now go to the background and set
[124:47.28]it as the following background color as
[124:49.92]0 B 1020.
[124:56.08]Okay, this element. So the idea of this
[125:00.40]element is we will write code in here
[125:03.28]later. Then we can run and it will the
[125:06.63]the the result will show in this box in
[125:09.76]this preview environment. Okay, like
[125:11.92]this. So this div here which is the
[125:15.04]editor. This is the editor. Here we
[125:17.76]write code. Then we can run and the
[125:21.84]result will show over here. So this box
[125:24.80]is called editor rab. It's called editor
[125:27.44]rab. And by the way you can play around
[125:30.32]with the editor ra as you want. You can
[125:32.88]set the position here. As I said
[125:35.59]position relative. If we give it
[125:38.00]position for example static it will
[125:40.40]become static. Why? We cannot use top.
[125:43.84]For example top 10 pixels. You can see
[125:46.48]we cannot use top. But when you we once
[125:49.59]we set the position to relative well we
[125:52.71]can move that element as we want. You
[125:55.59]can see the flexibility of CSS. When you
[125:58.08]set a position to relative the
[125:59.84]possibility it opens a window of
[126:02.63]possibilities. We can change the top
[126:04.96]property, the bottom property also the
[126:07.19]bottom to 10 pixels.
[126:10.08]And also we can play around with the
[126:11.59]left. So left to have a left of for
[126:14.00]example this amount. So we can we can
[126:16.71]turn or we can move that element to the
[126:18.80]left side
[126:20.80]or also we can play around with the
[126:22.63]right. Okay. So we can feel free to play
[126:26.00]around with it. But the suitable way is
[126:29.11]to make it the default. But we need to
[126:32.00]set it to position relative to set this
[126:34.96]element to be relative in terms of its
[126:37.36]surrounding elements or to to be
[126:39.76]relative and controllable and
[126:41.92]controllable via top, right, left,
[126:44.15]bottom properties.
[126:47.59]Let's move on to the editor. the editor
[126:50.32]element dot editor and then specify a
[126:53.76]line size of 100%. And also the block
[126:58.32]size of 380 pixels. So note in here uh
[127:03.44]the editor ra has a minimum height of
[127:06.40]280 pixels but now the editor has a
[127:10.07]block size of 380 pixels. The block size
[127:13.36]is a property that controls the height
[127:16.40]of the element. So yeah, we have 380.
[127:19.44]Let's reload. Now we have a more lengthy
[127:23.84]element because why? If we emit or or
[127:26.63]comment this property block size 380
[127:29.19]pixels, then it will just uh it will
[127:32.15]just be 280 pixels. Why? because of set
[127:35.52]the minimum height the lowest possible
[127:38.23]height for this editor wrap should be
[127:40.96]280 pixels and it shouldn't become lower
[127:44.56]than this value because the minimum
[127:46.63]height is a restriction property. So now
[127:50.23]if you check from here the console what
[127:52.23]is the height of this element by
[127:53.92]hovering over it the height now is what
[127:56.56]is 280 is 280 pixels as you can see from
[127:59.76]the window here. But since but once we
[128:03.67]define the block size to 380 pixels then
[128:07.04]the height of this code editor will
[128:09.67]become now what as 380 pixels. Okay. So
[128:13.92]this is the idea and the the behavior of
[128:17.52]block size working alongside with
[128:20.71]minimum height and also feel free to
[128:23.28]change the color here to to any color of
[128:25.76]the editor. You can see you can you can
[128:28.88]change this color to whatever color you
[128:31.28]need. For example, if you change this to
[128:33.11]this color, it will become like that.
[128:36.07]But let's now return it back to our uh
[128:38.88]black color because most code editors
[128:41.76]have a black theme like a Dracula theme.
[128:44.32]Then we have here overflow hidden. Why?
[128:46.71]Because we don't need the codes to
[128:49.92]overwrite this section. We need a scroll
[128:52.88]element here that we can scroll and see
[128:56.15]all the codes. For example, if you have
[128:59.28]a lot of codes here,
[129:02.96]here we will have a scroll bar. we can
[129:06.07]scroll. So the overflow is hidden. We we
[129:08.48]we want to hide the codes but should be
[129:11.84]able to scroll and see the following and
[129:14.00]the rest of the codes. So we do not want
[129:15.92]the codes to overflow and become over
[129:19.04]this element become over this parent.
[129:21.11]Okay, this is the overflow hidden
[129:23.04]element or property and also the border
[129:25.36]radius. Let's set it to 20 pixels to see
[129:28.00]the effect. Here the border radius is
[129:31.36]14. Now 20 it will become more radius.
[129:35.52]Okay. But let's keep it
[129:38.23]more kind radius as 14 pixels. Now let's
[129:42.32]move on to the I frame dot preview
[129:45.92]element. Now the I frame element is this
[129:48.96]area here that will show the result of
[129:51.92]our project of our coded project. Let's
[129:54.80]go in line size 100%.
[129:57.92]So the width and the block size let's
[130:00.40]set it to 380 pixels the same as the
[130:04.00]what the code editor border as 1 pixel
[130:07.92]solid and then RGBA of 255 255 255 comma
[130:12.63]0.12 and then let's set the border-
[130:15.67]radius to have a radius value of 40
[130:18.00]pixels and also a background of white or
[130:20.88]we can say hash fff.
[130:24.32]Okay, now let's see here what happens to
[130:26.80]this I if frame element and it becomes
[130:29.28]now an iframe an iframe element ready to
[130:32.71]show our results ready to showcase our
[130:35.92]project how by giving it an align size
[130:39.36]of 100% so it takes the full available
[130:43.11]width of its parent and then we have a
[130:45.59]block size of 380 pixels so it become uh
[130:49.11]the the height becomes more and more so
[130:52.32]here if you check what is the height of
[130:54.48]this iron if it is now currently it says
[130:57.84]here it's 380 pixels you can see here
[131:00.96]the height is 380 pixels why because of
[131:04.96]set that here the block d size as 380
[131:07.92]pixels and also it has a border we can
[131:10.40]set a border to 10 pixels to verify that
[131:12.71]it has a border
[131:15.04]here the border okay of this of of the
[131:18.56]frame element and also but the border
[131:20.80]here is white so we can change the color
[131:23.84]to have a blue border
[131:29.92]by going to the blue channel and
[131:32.15]choosing a blue color.
[131:35.92]So here we have you can see the border
[131:38.40]the border of the element but we don't
[131:40.96]need this border to be in a blue in a
[131:43.19]blue color.
[131:45.67]To make it clearer we can change it to a
[131:47.92]red color. Now we have a red color.
[131:51.67]Okay. and the opacity. If you if you
[131:53.67]don't want opacity, we can get rid of
[131:55.36]the opacity here and get rid of of the A
[131:57.84]channel.
[132:00.07]Now we have a red border. But if you
[132:03.19]want to choose another border, feel free
[132:05.52]to play around with that. And we have
[132:07.84]border border radius set as 14 pixels.
[132:13.36]Let's move on to the next step, which is
[132:16.00]the out element. So recall we have a
[132:19.52]little div here with the out class. If
[132:22.63]you go to the last assign here, now
[132:24.80]we've we've really near the finish of
[132:26.96]CSS. Here we have div id output class
[132:30.56]out. So this div with the class out.
[132:33.84]Let's set for it the following. Let's
[132:36.80]give it a background of 0 a 0 e 1 a. And
[132:44.40]then let's give it a border of 1 pixel
[132:47.44]solid. So the type of the border is
[132:49.36]solid and rgba of 255 255 255, 0.12.
[132:56.56]Let's set a border radius of 12 pixels.
[133:00.48]Let's give it a padding of 10 pixels.
[133:02.88]And let's set a minimum height. Give it
[133:05.19]a minimum height available height as 160
[133:08.96]pixels. And also set the overflow as
[133:12.15]auto
[133:14.00]whites space as preab pr. Now the out
[133:19.28]element here is this div. So this div
[133:22.15]element this is the out element. We need
[133:25.04]to give it the following styles. You can
[133:26.80]see here I think the border radius here
[133:29.36]is over border radius as 12 pixels. Not
[133:33.11]120 pixels as 12 pixels. But but I've
[133:36.88]misspelled that and wrote a zero there.
[133:40.40]You can see now we have a reasonable uh
[133:42.80]border radius ver div that will show the
[133:45.44]output. When we click on run with tests,
[133:47.92]it will show the tests. It will show the
[133:50.07]logs and we can clear that logs by
[133:52.40]clicking on this button and it will
[133:54.23]clear out the logs. Okay,
[133:57.92]feel free to play around with those
[133:59.36]values. Padding minimum height 160. Now
[134:04.40]let's go to the footer dot footer
[134:07.19]element and give it an opacity. So the
[134:09.76]footer element have an opacity of 0.7
[134:13.04]and then also so if you if you want to
[134:14.96]see the opacity now you can see the
[134:16.88]footer 3 2 1 reload. Now it has an
[134:20.88]opacity ratio. Okay. Uh it will be not
[134:25.44]that clear. So if you make them 0.1 for
[134:28.23]example it will become unvisible nearly
[134:32.40]unvisible but if you make them 0.9
[134:37.36]then it will be more visible but let's
[134:40.32]keep it seven. Then let's give it an a
[134:42.48]font size of 12 pixels to make it
[134:45.59]smaller and give it a text align as
[134:48.40]center and also set a padding of 12
[134:52.07]pixels.
[134:56.07]Now we have a text align.
[134:58.88]You can see the footer here. We have a
[135:00.80]text align center. The font size is 12
[135:04.63]pixels and it has a padding of 12
[135:07.19]pixels.
[135:09.19]The font size we can make it bigger. For
[135:11.04]example, 17 pixels
[135:16.32]like that. So 25 you can see the
[135:19.04]copyright uh symbol 25 program academy
[135:23.36]all rights reserved and we can move on
[135:25.92]to the
[135:28.71]uh we can start the KBD which is the
[135:30.88]keyboard element
[135:32.96]the keyboard element KBD and give it the
[135:36.00]following font family as UI- mono space
[135:40.96]and also give it a background of zero E
[135:48.00]1 3 4 uh 24.
[135:52.07]So I think it's 0 E 0 E1 1324. And also
[135:56.48]set a border of one pixel solid and RGBA
[136:01.44]red green blue alpha 255 255 255 0.15
[136:08.23]border dash radius. Let's make the
[136:10.40]border rounded uh 8 pixels and also give
[136:14.71]it a padding of two pixels six pixels.
[136:17.92]Now let's uh watch that you can see now
[136:21.76]here we have the keyboard elements these
[136:25.36]uh spans elements ctrl srl enter 3 2 1
[136:30.40]now we have these elements like that. So
[136:33.92]the effect of that uh the user should
[136:37.35]press Ctrl + S. So this effect has
[136:40.55]become due to the fact that we've used
[136:43.28]the following styles. Here we have a
[136:45.28]font family of UI monospace and also we
[136:48.88]can use another font which is SF mono-
[136:53.92]regular which will make which will make
[136:55.84]the font and also let's use Melo. You
[136:59.28]can see men low and also consolus.
[137:04.00]So now it is in a console mode. So
[137:06.24]without consolus note the the the font
[137:10.00]here. Once we put consolus it becomes
[137:13.67]like that
[137:16.39]comma
[137:18.47]casadia
[137:20.47]code string comma mono space. Okay. So
[137:25.59]you can see now we have this type of
[137:28.00]font. If you emit this it becomes like
[137:32.16]that. But if you use it it becomes like
[137:34.55]that. And we have a font.
[137:38.16]So the font family as this UI monospace
[137:41.67]SF mono regular and also melo
[137:47.04]c o n s o ls and cascadia code
[137:50.31]monospace. And also let's give it h a
[137:54.08]background color of this color. You can
[137:56.31]change it to whatever color. For
[137:57.92]example, this color.
[138:03.59]You can see it have a another color. But
[138:06.80]let's keep it like that. And also a
[138:08.63]border. Border radius. We can increase
[138:10.80]that to 20 pixels to see the effect.
[138:16.63]Let's keep it as 8 pixels. and the
[138:18.80]padding of two pixels six pixels. Feel
[138:21.51]free to change that. Let's move on to
[138:24.24]the last element label. So the label has
[138:27.67]a font size of
[138:30.71]font size
[138:33.04]of 13 pixels and then color as the
[138:37.35]variable muted.
[138:40.88]here the label I think
[138:45.67]I think we don't we don't have elements
[138:47.43]with the label tag label label class
[138:51.28]label
[138:52.96]we don't have elements with the class
[138:54.24]label but if we provide these two leaves
[138:57.20]with the class label for example class
[138:59.84]label then they will have the class
[139:03.04]label
[139:05.28]the same. So the font size here is 13
[139:08.08]pixels and the color v muted. We can
[139:10.55]change for example the font size to 15
[139:12.80]pixels and it will become larger. Okay.
[139:17.67]So now we finished writing the CSS
[139:20.16]section successfully. As you can see
[139:24.47]this is the styling of our page. So,
[139:27.84]we've gone from a backbone webpage HTML
[139:30.96]into this really beautiful, really
[139:34.55]magnificent, impressive layout. You can
[139:37.43]see the items are arranged in a
[139:40.16]beautiful and fancy way. The items are
[139:43.43]uh in a grid mode and also these buttons
[139:46.24]have a transparent background. The also
[139:48.96]the title is now in a reasonable uh font
[139:52.88]size. You can see here we can write
[139:54.80]later the codes. And once we click on
[139:57.28]run with this, it will produce the
[139:59.04]outputs here. So feel free to change any
[140:02.80]of those stylings. Those stylings are
[140:04.96]considered uh not hard, not crafted in
[140:08.16]stone. You can change any of those. So
[140:11.04]now I think we have to move on to the
[140:13.60]JavaScript section. So see you in the
[140:16.08]JavaScript section
[140:18.56]and let's dive into JS. Let's dive into
[140:22.64]the JavaScript section. So recall in the
[140:26.00]last section we did the CSS styling.
[140:29.60]Okay. So now if we if we disconnect the
[140:33.52]CSS from the HTML by doing that the HTML
[140:38.24]page becomes a backbone structure like
[140:42.00]that. But once we connect the CSS, this
[140:46.47]golden CSS file to to the HTML, it
[140:49.84]becomes from this structure into this
[140:53.52]styling. Okay.
[140:56.08]But now in this section, let's dive into
[140:58.16]the JS. First, we need to define some
[141:01.60]utilities. So let's put some equals
[141:05.52]utilities utilities and then some
[141:08.64]equals. The utilities are as the
[141:11.12]following constant and then let's name
[141:13.20]it as a dollar sign equals s then the
[141:17.43]arrow function in JS document dot query
[141:21.43]selector
[141:23.20]s. Basically what this dollar sign
[141:27.20]function does is we pass a selector a do
[141:31.43]selector to this function and then this
[141:34.24]function will try to select that
[141:36.24]element. For example, now if you go to
[141:39.68]this HTML page and use dollar sign and
[141:44.00]pass in here the class muted,
[141:48.08]you can see it choose the it chooses the
[141:50.16]first muted div, the first muted div.
[141:53.28]The same goes for any of the ids or
[141:56.16]classes. For example, let's try with the
[141:58.56]div. This is the first div in the page.
[142:01.28]So this function dollar sign chooses or
[142:04.16]selects whichever element ID or class
[142:07.84]whichever class selector or selector you
[142:10.56]pass it here. It will pass it to the
[142:12.39]query selector and choose that element
[142:14.47]and then return it via the arrow
[142:16.96]function. Next let's go to the constant
[142:19.43]double dollar sign equals s. We pass a
[142:22.64]select a parameter. So this is an
[142:24.39]argument or parameter. Then we try to
[142:27.43]grab that element to fetch that element
[142:30.08]using query selector all
[142:34.96]and then pass s. Then if we want to
[142:37.84]convert this node list, this returns
[142:40.24]here note. This returns a descendence of
[142:43.28]node, we we need to pass it to a to
[142:46.24]array dot match array dot from to
[142:51.43]convert it from a node list into a a
[142:54.64]normal JavaScript array. So let's try it
[142:57.84]here.
[142:59.84]double dollar sign then pass in here the
[143:02.16]class muted.
[143:04.39]It will return a array. You can say an
[143:06.88]array of two divs or two elements div
[143:10.24]with a class muted and a ul with the
[143:12.56]class muted. So every single element
[143:14.64]with the class muted. If you try the
[143:17.12]last try here, if you try double dollar
[143:19.43]sign and then pass here div, it will
[143:21.52]return a massive array of 21 elements,
[143:25.20]all divs elements. So these two
[143:28.00]functions are magic functions. they will
[143:30.72]choose or grab or fetch whichever DOM
[143:33.52]selectors we pass. But this function the
[143:36.47]single dollar sign will choose the only
[143:38.96]the first occurrence of the element. But
[143:42.24]this double dollar sign will choose all
[143:45.12]of the occurrences of the elements
[143:46.96]inside a document page. Then let's
[143:49.84]create a constant out equals a dollar
[143:52.72]sign. Let's leverage the dollar sign
[143:54.88]function and pass here the ID output.
[143:58.47]the ID output
[144:01.84]and then let's also use the
[144:05.52]pre uh let's create a constant called
[144:07.92]preview and use or leverage the single
[144:11.60]dollar sign function and pass in here
[144:14.00]the hash preview.
[144:16.47]Also let's create another constant
[144:19.28]called storage key equals
[144:22.96]academy for example dash code lab dash
[144:28.16]web.
[144:30.31]So basically what these constants are
[144:33.12]the out previous preview storage key the
[144:35.43]out constant leverage or uses the the
[144:38.16]single dollar sign function and grabs or
[144:41.04]fetches the element with the ID output.
[144:44.08]Recall in the HTML which element has the
[144:46.96]id output. Here we have this div with id
[144:51.28]output. So here in DJS we have selected
[144:54.16]that element via the hash id output. And
[144:57.43]if we try to print it here output we
[145:00.47]have this div the div output. And the
[145:03.04]same goes for this constant preview.
[145:05.28]Recall what which element has the
[145:07.43]preview id. If you go to the HTML, well,
[145:11.12]the I frame element has the ID preview.
[145:15.35]So, we have selected the I frame via
[145:18.16]using the d the single dollar sign
[145:20.56]function and pass the ID preview. And we
[145:23.20]can write here preview, we have this I
[145:26.08]frame. If you go down, this is this is
[145:28.72]the I frame which is the preview
[145:31.12]constant in JS. And lastly we have a
[145:34.08]constant a normal constant that's named
[145:36.96]str key contains whichever text you want
[145:39.76]in this case academy code lab code lab
[145:41.76]web this constant will be used later to
[145:44.72]store the contents inside a local
[145:47.84]storage here but it will store it under
[145:51.35]this name which is this name it will
[145:53.76]store it under this name under this
[145:55.76]title academy codelab web you can choose
[145:58.16]whichever text you want let's move on to
[146:00.16]the next section which is constant
[146:02.31]escape HTML. Simply what does this
[146:05.92]function does? It takes from me a s
[146:09.76]parameter s argument and leverages the
[146:13.20]the arrow function and then convert that
[146:16.16]s parameter into a string. So you know
[146:20.16]that the string class in JavaScript
[146:22.72]converts whichever passed to it into a
[146:25.04]string. So if you try here for example
[146:28.31]here in the console try uh for example
[146:31.84]we have the value undefined. We all know
[146:34.80]that undefined is something undefined
[146:36.88]like that undefined
[146:39.92]is a value is is a value that is
[146:42.24]undefined. If we pass undefined to a
[146:45.04]string undefined it will convert the
[146:47.76]undefined into what? Into a string. The
[146:50.56]same goes for the null. If we pass here
[146:53.60]null, the value null, it will convert
[146:56.31]the null into a string. Whichever gets
[146:58.88]passed to this class string will be
[147:01.68]converted into what? Into a string. The
[147:04.24]string will convert any JavaScript
[147:07.20]object into a string format. For
[147:09.20]example, if we pass to the to the string
[147:11.52]class the name JS, it will convert it
[147:14.80]into it will convert it it will convert
[147:17.12]it into JS. Also if you pass in here a
[147:20.80]number for example 10 the 10 number the
[147:24.08]10 integer will be converted into a
[147:26.80]string via the string class. Then let's
[147:30.39]move on to the next step uh step
[147:32.24]dotreplace. Let's try to replace. So we
[147:35.35]now we have a string. Let's replace any
[147:37.68]character that matches this criteria
[147:40.64]which is slash
[147:43.12]and then open square brackets
[147:45.43]ampersandercand
[147:47.68]and then lower than symbol greater than
[147:51.84]symbol double quotation mark and then
[147:54.72]let's put here / g. So / G this flag
[147:58.72]means replace all occurrences not just
[148:02.24]replace the first occurrence of these
[148:04.08]characters but please this is a regular
[148:07.12]expression change whichever character
[148:10.24]that matches this pattern and change or
[148:12.88]replace all every single occurrence
[148:16.64]and then let's pass a C here the the C
[148:19.52]that gets gets returned by the replace
[148:21.92]here and do an arrow function open
[148:25.20]parenthesis and then curly brackets
[148:27.76]let's replace the amberand if you have
[148:30.08]the amberand let's replace it into this
[148:32.72]entity so remember the entities in the
[148:35.20]HTML in the footer this entity which is
[148:38.00]amberand copy semicolon we have to
[148:40.96]convert these characters these special
[148:44.08]characters into entities to be
[148:46.31]interpretable via HTML so here amber am
[148:50.96]so am is short for amberand then let's
[148:55.68]use a lower than symbol or uh smaller
[148:59.60]than symbol and convert into uh convert
[149:02.39]it into the lt emperand lt semicolon so
[149:07.92]lower than lt is for lower than then
[149:10.88]let's go for the greater than
[149:14.39]percent gt so greater than and also
[149:18.24]let's put here a double quotation mark
[149:20.31]so we have to use now single quotation
[149:23.04]marks and put in here a double quotation
[149:25.68]mark and replace it with this percent
[149:28.88]quote qo t semicolon qo t semicolon
[149:35.92]okay so q u o t semicolon so we need to
[149:40.64]convert or map these symbols to these
[149:43.76]entities to these HTML entities gt is
[149:46.96]short for greater than so it will
[149:49.12]replace this symbol with this entity
[149:51.28]which will be interpretable in the HTML
[149:53.84]language that this is the symbol of
[149:57.20]greater than of greater than or larger
[149:58.88]than and the quotation mark will be as
[150:01.12]quote.
[150:03.35]Now let's put here after the curly
[150:07.12]brackets let's put square brackets C. So
[150:10.56]we want to index on the C and then let's
[150:13.52]put here a semicolon.
[150:18.31]So we have to close here a a a a square
[150:22.00]brackets square a curly brackets
[150:26.16]like that.
[150:29.28]Here we need to put after the C we have
[150:31.84]to put square brackets uh we have to put
[150:35.76]curly brackets then at index C then also
[150:39.60]we have to close this parenthesis with
[150:41.84]another parenthesis like that.
[150:50.56]this error I think expected semicolon
[150:54.80]uh because we have we need to we we
[150:57.92]didn't need to to close the the replace
[151:00.00]here we have to close it here over here
[151:01.52]yeah like that we have to close the
[151:03.28]replace function over here now we have
[151:06.08]finished writing the escape HTML
[151:08.08]function which will escape the special
[151:10.64]characters which will escape the I I
[151:14.24]would say sensitive ensitive characters
[151:16.31]sensitive characters into these entities
[151:19.04]to make the HTML safer and less prone to
[151:23.04]XRSS attacks to XSS attacks. Okay, let's
[151:28.47]move on to the function and let's move
[151:30.16]on to writing a function called log. The
[151:33.52]log function message, type equals info.
[151:37.52]So this function is called log. This
[151:40.08]function in JavaScript will take from me
[151:42.24]a msg message. MSG is short for message.
[151:46.31]Will take from me a message parameter
[151:48.24]and the default type is info. And do the
[151:51.04]following constant color. We will color
[151:54.56]this message by if the type of the of
[151:57.76]the message equals equals equals error.
[152:02.31]Then let's convert or let's use the
[152:05.68]variable here. Let's use a string the
[152:07.92]variable of d- error.
[152:11.84]We can use here single quotation marks
[152:15.84]otherwise. So colon means otherwise if
[152:19.43]the type equals equals equals warn. So
[152:22.80]warning let's set the color as the
[152:26.39]following variable of d-ashwn
[152:31.28]and then else. So other than this and
[152:34.56]other than this let's use at the end a
[152:37.92]variable. So this is the else a variable
[152:40.31]of the color dash brand. Okay.
[152:45.52]So here we have a constant of color. If
[152:47.92]the type equals equals equals error then
[152:51.20]the returned value is variable error.
[152:54.64]And if the type equals equals warning
[152:57.84]then set the color as warning. Otherwise
[153:00.56]else use a color of brand.
[153:03.92]Then let's create a constant time equals
[153:06.96]new date. Let's instantiate a new date.
[153:09.92]Instantiate a new date object dot to
[153:13.20]local to local time string. Okay, we
[153:17.43]have to write here to local like that.
[153:19.92]like that time string and then go to the
[153:23.76]next line. Create another constant time
[153:26.00]uh line equals document dot create
[153:31.28]element. We have to create an element.
[153:33.35]So in the JavaScript document document
[153:36.24]object model DOM to create an element we
[153:39.35]use or leverage the function create
[153:41.35]element. So document create element to
[153:43.68]create a new element to create and
[153:45.84]insert a new element in the HTML web
[153:48.39]page. And then this element is div. And
[153:51.84]we pass here the name of the element. So
[153:53.84]you can create another element for
[153:55.28]example span or section. Whichever
[153:58.31]element you want to create pass the name
[154:00.47]of it. In this case we need to pass here
[154:02.80]a div. So we have to create a div
[154:05.12]element and store it in this line
[154:08.08]constant. Then let's go to line in HTML
[154:12.47]equals uh use a tilda span style equals
[154:18.47]color. So the color equals the constant
[154:24.08]color here. So whichever value gets
[154:26.96]returned from these conditions this is a
[154:29.04]turnary operator. This is called in
[154:30.80]JavaScript a turnary operator. So this
[154:33.35]question mark colon is called a turnary
[154:36.00]operator. So we are doing some
[154:37.60]conditions here. If the type equals
[154:39.52]error, if this type equals error, use
[154:41.84]this error error color. Then we will use
[154:44.56]this this color that gets returned to
[154:47.43]this concept. We will leverage it here
[154:50.08]color.
[154:51.76]Then close this double quotation mark.
[154:54.24]Close that element and then uh put
[154:57.35]square brackets here. Double dollar
[155:00.72]sign. And then also put squiggly
[155:03.35]brackets or uh
[155:06.56]curly brackets. Then let's write in here
[155:08.47]time.
[155:10.47]Then let's close that span. So we have
[155:13.04]here span / span
[155:16.16]the span element. And also let's write
[155:18.88]in here uh curly brackets escape html.
[155:23.04]Let's use our escape htm function escape
[155:25.68]html that we have created over here. we
[155:28.08]have this constant escape html and pass
[155:31.20]into this function msg. So when we pass
[155:35.20]the message if this message contains any
[155:37.52]of these special sensitive characters
[155:40.16]like the emperand lower than greater
[155:42.96]than double question mark it will be
[155:45.04]replaced into safe entities and will be
[155:47.68]interpretable and will be explainable by
[155:50.47]the HTML language. And let's put here
[155:53.84]semicolon. Let's move on to the next
[155:56.72]line.
[155:58.00]which uh out. So the out element recall
[156:01.20]what is the out element here? This
[156:02.80]constant out that contains a single
[156:06.00]dollar sign function and then grabs the
[156:08.47]output
[156:10.24]element. So out inner happend child
[156:14.47]let's append a child
[156:17.43]append child and pass into here the line
[156:20.56]element. Then let's go to the next line.
[156:23.76]Out dot scroll top equals out dot scroll
[156:29.35]scroll height semicolon. So we have to
[156:34.24]change the scroll behavior. Scroll top
[156:37.04]equals out dot scroll height. Why? Note
[156:42.16]in here now we are talking we with the
[156:45.43]with this we are talking about this div
[156:48.00]when we run the app.
[156:52.39]Okay it will make the scroll note here
[156:56.56]the scroll behavior. So every time we
[156:59.20]run
[157:00.88]okay the behavior is like that out
[157:03.43]append child it appends a new child
[157:05.76]which is this span element.
[157:08.31]This span gets appended here. This is a
[157:10.64]span element that contains what?
[157:12.64]Contains the time. So here we have the
[157:14.80]time that we have instantiated over
[157:16.64]here. So new date dot to local time
[157:20.31]string. Then we append that time inside
[157:23.68]the span and we make the color of that
[157:27.12]time. Okay. Depending on this type. So
[157:31.04]here if the type here is for example
[157:33.92]error the
[157:36.24]this type will be in red in red color.
[157:38.88]If it's in a warning mode, it will be in
[157:41.68]a warning color and otherwise it will be
[157:43.76]as the brand color. For example, in this
[157:46.24]case, it is now in the brand color
[157:48.08]because there is no any issues. But if
[157:50.24]you have some issues here, for example,
[157:52.47]uh if you write here some issues, okay,
[157:56.88]sometimes it shows this in a red color.
[157:58.88]Okay. But but the idea here is that
[158:01.28]depending on this constant color, it
[158:03.68]will change the color the style the
[158:05.84]color of the span and also it will
[158:07.84]append that child and the scroll top.
[158:10.16]Note here when we run again and again
[158:12.72]always it will make the scroll top. So
[158:15.20]it will show the last element by by
[158:18.00]setting the scroll top equals
[158:21.28]out dot scroll height with capital H.
[158:23.76]Let's move on to the next function
[158:25.60]function which is clear out. This is an
[158:28.72]interesting function clear out. This
[158:30.56]function will clear the log here. Okay.
[158:33.12]So clear out and then pass into here
[158:35.84]out. So let's use here out dot in HTML
[158:42.24]equals an empty string. So all this
[158:44.47]function does is an empty thing. It just
[158:47.76]clears the in HTML. It simply makes it
[158:51.12]an empty string. So once we click on
[158:53.68]this clear log, nothing here by simply
[158:58.08]setting the inner HTML property to equal
[159:00.31]an empty string. That as simple as it
[159:02.88]is. Then let's move on to the next thing
[159:06.56]which is here. Let's use the
[159:10.16]single dollar sign function and pass
[159:12.56]into here the hash clear out. So we are
[159:16.39]leveraging the single dollar sign and
[159:18.39]passing here the ID of clear out and
[159:21.04]then use this question mark dot add
[159:23.52]event listener add event listener
[159:28.64]and pass into here the click event and
[159:31.28]then let's run that clear out function.
[159:35.20]So all this function does or all this
[159:37.52]line does it seeks for the clear out
[159:40.96]element. Let's copy that and run it in
[159:44.08]the console.
[159:47.60]We have null currently. We have null the
[159:50.24]uh the the element with the ID of clear
[159:53.04]out. And then we put a question mark.
[159:57.60]This question mark will get the element
[160:00.47]if it exists. Otherwise, if this element
[160:03.68]does not exist, it won't raise an error.
[160:06.72]So this question mark is a really
[160:08.64]interesting and helpful way to if you
[160:11.92]are unsure about whe whether this
[160:14.88]element exists or not and you do not
[160:18.31]want JavaScript to cry at you, you don't
[160:21.12]want JavaScript to cry and make some
[160:24.24]errors in the console, you can put this
[160:26.08]question mark. This question mark makes
[160:28.39]the flow of the code safe and makes the
[160:31.04]running of the of the file safer by how?
[160:34.24]by emitting if this element exists or
[160:37.43]not. If this element does not exist, it
[160:40.08]will it won't raise an error and also it
[160:43.43]won't do anything. It will just ignore
[160:45.35]what is in there. But if this element
[160:47.60]exists, it will perform what is in there
[160:50.16]which is the add event listener. Click
[160:53.35]run this function clear out. So when
[160:56.08]clicking on this clear out element, I
[160:58.88]think we don't have it right now. clear
[161:01.28]out and the id of it here of the clear
[161:04.72]out here. So div id output this button.
[161:08.08]So we have to give it this button. We
[161:09.68]have to give it an id of clear out. Now
[161:12.72]we do have that element. Let's go again.
[161:16.00]Seek again here. Uh dollar sign clear
[161:19.35]out.
[161:23.84]If you take it from here,
[161:26.39]yeah, we need hash sign. So if you put
[161:28.72]here a hash sign ID, we have this
[161:30.88]button. Once we click on it, it will
[161:33.28]clear the the logs in here. Okay, if you
[161:36.56]take this segment of code dollar sign
[161:39.76]#clear out and put it in the console,
[161:42.16]now we have that button element. Once we
[161:44.39]click on it, it will clear out the the
[161:47.76]logs. Let's move on to the next function
[161:51.35]make editor. This function make editor
[161:54.39]will take from me two parameters ID,
[161:57.12]mode.
[161:58.72]Simply it will create a constant. So
[162:02.47]let's create a constant called ed. ed is
[162:05.43]short for editor. And let's go ace.edit.
[162:10.16]So ace is a module.
[162:14.31]Okay, that will help us build this code
[162:16.56]editor.edit.
[162:18.56]The function edit will take from me the
[162:21.20]ID. So the ID of the editor whether it
[162:24.24]was HTML, CSS or JavaScript, comma and
[162:27.76]here we have a a dictionary in
[162:30.39]JavaScript terms in JavaScript
[162:32.24]terminology. This is called a JavaScript
[162:34.16]object. So here we have a JavaScript
[162:36.00]object and let's write here theme. So
[162:39.28]the key theme should be equal as a
[162:41.60]as/the
[162:44.64]dracula. So the Dracula theme like this
[162:47.52]visual code now this visual zero code
[162:50.16]has a Dracula theme. This theme is
[162:52.08]called the Dracula. If you go to here to
[162:54.31]file and then go to theme
[162:58.08]here to change the theme. So preferences
[163:00.80]then we have here settings or themes
[163:04.00]like yeah themes and then color themes.
[163:06.64]Here you can see we have dark and also
[163:08.64]we have Dracula. Dracula.
[163:13.60]Some themes here are called Dracula. So
[163:15.52]you can you can download that if you
[163:17.20]don't have it. I think currently I don't
[163:19.04]have it. So I need to to download it.
[163:21.52]But there is a an a popular theme that
[163:23.92]is called Dracula. So as theme dracula,
[163:27.60]comma, let's specify the mode. Let's
[163:30.24]pass here the mode,
[163:32.80]tab size. So the tab size should be as
[163:35.68]two. So what is the tab size you want
[163:38.24]currently here? The tab size if you if
[163:40.31]you do some taps here like that. tab the
[163:43.76]tab size is of two spaces. So you
[163:47.04]specify how many spaces you want to add
[163:50.88]whenever you press on tab. So the tab
[163:53.60]size now is two, let's specify the use
[163:57.52]soft tabs as true. So do you want to use
[164:01.20]soft tabs in this case? Yes, I do want
[164:03.60]to use soft tabs as true. And then show
[164:07.04]print margin specify it as false. So
[164:10.96]show print margin as false comma lastly
[164:14.08]wrap as true. Do you want to wrap? So
[164:17.04]for example when you write more codes
[164:19.04]like that and then go crazy it will uh
[164:22.56]reach some point and then wraps. Okay.
[164:24.80]So again you can see write code write
[164:27.27]code write code write code. At some
[164:29.12]point it just wraps. So do you want that
[164:33.27]behavior? If yes wrap as true. Set it as
[164:36.72]true. Then let's put a semicolon. So
[164:39.84]these are some general settings of the
[164:42.00]editor theme use a theme of
[164:44.31]ace/theracula
[164:46.56]comma mode and then the mode. So the
[164:48.88]mode here is is this is this parameter
[164:51.35]passed to the function make it and then
[164:53.84]tab size two use soft tabs set as true
[164:57.43]and then show print margin. Show print
[165:00.08]margin set as false and then wrap as
[165:02.56]true. Let's move on to the next block
[165:04.80]which is editor session. Let's set up a
[165:07.12]session for the editor. editor dot
[165:09.84]session dot set user or set use raet use
[165:14.88]rab mode. This function set use ra mode
[165:18.64]takes from me a true. So do you want to
[165:21.84]set use ra mode.
[165:24.80]And then let's set up a command. So
[165:27.60]editor dot commands the commands module
[165:31.92]commands
[165:33.52]and then dot add command
[165:36.72]pass into here a javascript object. Well
[165:40.00]now we have to name this command. Let's
[165:42.47]name it as run. So we will add a
[165:46.16]shortcut a keyboard shortcut. Whenever
[165:48.64]we click on control enter it will
[165:51.04]execute the project. So we want to name
[165:53.84]this behavior as run. So name run and
[165:57.52]then the bind key. So the bind key
[165:59.92]property or key we have to bind here we
[166:02.64]have to pass another sub dictionary or I
[166:05.27]would say JavaScript object and here
[166:07.52]pass windows. So the windows should be
[166:10.31]as control
[166:12.47]enter control then put a minus ass sign
[166:16.31]enter. So if we click controll enter it
[166:19.76]should run the code. Okay. Comma on Mac.
[166:24.31]On Mac, let's use
[166:26.96]a command command. You can you have to
[166:30.96]write command and then minus enter. So
[166:34.31]command enter on Mac on Mac OS if you
[166:36.64]have Mac OS uh in your laptop. And then
[166:40.00]let's com put comma execute. Let's run
[166:44.47]the execute function. And then we have
[166:46.88]here curly brackets run web. Let's do uh
[166:50.56]let's run the web and then pass into
[166:52.39]here false. then semicolon like that.
[166:55.84]Then we have to close off that and put
[166:57.35]here semicolon. After that, let's set up
[166:59.84]another command by going the same idea
[167:02.56]editor docomands dot add command. Let's
[167:06.47]use the add command function and pass
[167:09.12]into here a JavaScript object and name
[167:11.52]and then let's name that command as save
[167:14.64]because we want to save. Recall whenever
[167:16.72]we click on Ctrl S, we need to save.
[167:19.68]Look at that. It saves the project.
[167:22.31]Okay. So we need to specify that
[167:26.08]whenever clicking on the bind key here
[167:29.35]bind key let's pass into here windows
[167:32.72]should be as control minus we have to
[167:35.52]put a minus sign then the capital S
[167:39.04]letter on Mac OS we have to use or
[167:42.56]leverage control uh command command
[167:46.80]minus s to save then put semicolon uh
[167:50.64]put comma
[167:52.56]after this object and then execute
[167:56.16]function and run in here save project
[168:00.39]function. So now you may wonder from
[168:03.20]where did we get these functions run web
[168:05.92]and save project. Well when we click on
[168:09.04]this uh on this shortcut control S or
[168:12.31]control enter or command depending on
[168:14.80]your OS it will trigger that function
[168:18.00]run web and later we will create it
[168:20.96]later. So these functions are now not
[168:24.72]created yet. Later after a few steps we
[168:28.47]will create them and they will be
[168:30.24]triggered. They will be they will be
[168:32.24]run. They will run when we when we uh
[168:35.27]press Ctrl S or control enter.
[168:39.12]Let's move on to the next step which is
[168:41.20]return editor. So now we have configured
[168:43.68]the editor and now we are simply
[168:45.84]returning that configured editor that
[168:48.24]configured editor. Okay.
[168:51.43]Let's move on to the next step which is
[168:53.12]constant. Create a constant editor HTML
[168:56.72]equals make editor. So this function
[169:00.08]that we have created over here. So you
[169:01.92]can see now we are leveraging our nicely
[169:04.72]created function which is function make
[169:06.88]editor and we are now instantiating a
[169:09.84]new object a new constant from that
[169:12.24]function and passing here editor html
[169:16.56]comma. Here we have we are passing what
[169:18.72]the id recall the id of these divs. Here
[169:22.24]we have these divs
[169:24.24]div id editor html div id editor css we
[169:29.27]have to pass these ids editor css edit
[169:31.84]html and edit js okay respectively and
[169:35.68]then pass into here the mode which is
[169:37.84]as/the
[169:39.84]html
[169:41.52]here we have mode mode so as/mode/html
[169:46.24]as the following why because when we are
[169:49.68]now uh we when when we are clicking on
[169:51.84]the HTML tab. The mode here is in HTML
[169:54.80]language. But when we switch or move on
[169:56.96]to CSS, the mode should be converted
[169:59.20]into CSS mode. So here we have to pass
[170:02.08]into we have to pass into the mode
[170:04.47]parameter here. The mode parameter we
[170:06.88]have to pass as/mode/HTML.
[170:10.31]The same goes for the rest of the
[170:11.92]languages. edit CSS equals make editor.
[170:14.64]Let's call let's invoke the function
[170:17.52]make editor and pass into here editor
[170:20.39]css and pass the mode as a as slash mode
[170:24.88]/ css
[170:28.24]con editor_js
[170:30.16]equals make editor pass into here the ID
[170:33.35]recall the ID is editor_js
[170:36.39]pass it to here and comma ace slash mode
[170:40.72]slash we have to write javascript so we
[170:44.08]do not have to write or we don't we
[170:46.80]don't need to write here JS or we don't
[170:49.12]need that we don't want that we have to
[170:51.04]write we have to write Java script in a
[170:53.84]full version JavaScript okay and put
[170:57.35]semicolon here the function make editor
[171:00.56]takes from me an ID and a mode and
[171:03.27]instantiate a new editor ED by going
[171:06.24]edit ace edit so the ACE module doedit
[171:09.76]and pass the ID and sets the theme sets
[171:12.96]the theme as a
[171:14.39]theme Dracula. So it establishes the
[171:16.96]Dracula theme and then set the tab size
[171:19.84]of two spaces. Use soft tabs as true.
[171:22.88]Show print margin false wrap true. And
[171:25.68]then it set use wrap mode function to
[171:28.24]true. We pass here. And we also we have
[171:30.96]bind the keys here of Windows and
[171:33.27]command of Windows and Mac. Bind key.
[171:36.39]Control enter to run. And it will
[171:39.68]trigger this function run web. And the
[171:41.68]same goes here. We have bind the key
[171:44.16]ctrl s that we need to save and we need
[171:47.60]to trigger this function save project.
[171:50.72]Okay.
[171:53.60]Now let's create another constant called
[171:56.08]tab order. So this is an important
[171:58.72]constant which will define the tab
[172:01.12]order. It will be a array that contains
[172:03.76]HTML, CSS, JS. So first we have HTML
[172:08.39]then we have CSS then JavaScript. So
[172:10.88]this is the tab order. Then let's create
[172:12.88]a constant wraps equals object object in
[172:17.27]JavaScript. Okay. Dot from entries this
[172:21.60]method we have to pass via the single
[172:24.64]dollar sign function and pass into here
[172:26.96]the id of web editors
[172:29.92]or the ID uh we need to leverage the
[172:33.76]double dollar sign function. Okay. So
[172:36.24]the double the dual double sign uh the
[172:39.68]dual dollar sign function and then pass
[172:42.24]here the id as web editors web editors
[172:46.80]and then inside this div we have another
[172:49.60]child which is editor wrap. Recall that
[172:52.64]inside this div web editors. Okay here
[172:55.92]we have a div id web editors inside this
[172:58.80]section which is which is this section.
[173:02.39]This section we have an a div here that
[173:06.47]contains the web editors.
[173:10.72]This web editors div contains here
[173:13.68]subdivs each div with a class of what?
[173:16.88]Of editor w editor rep editor-
[173:20.08]editor rep for HTML for CSS for
[173:23.04]JavaScript. We have to select them via
[173:25.35]using this uh double dollar sign
[173:28.31]function web editors and then dot
[173:30.39]editor-wrap and then that's called dot
[173:33.12]map the dot map function. We need to map
[173:36.56]the w and then an arrow function. Then
[173:41.12]we have here square brackets w dot data
[173:44.31]set dot pane comma w. So simply here we
[173:50.47]are passing a w parameter. This is a
[173:52.96]parameter passed to the arrow function
[173:55.43]and then w.datet here. Recall that we
[173:58.96]have this property. This is an important
[174:01.35]and golden property data pane. HTML data
[174:04.80]pane CSS data pane JavaScript. It is
[174:08.08]known in JavaScript. If you want to
[174:10.08]access any data property, for example,
[174:12.56]this property data pane, if you want to
[174:15.04]access it, if you have to access it, you
[174:17.20]have to use the data the data set
[174:20.31]attribute. So in order to access or to
[174:23.27]reach to this property data pane we have
[174:26.56]to access this
[174:29.76]property data set. So W dot data set
[174:34.00]dotpane and then we have to write the
[174:36.88]same word after the dash pain. So the
[174:40.64]word after the dash sign pain
[174:44.39]this word we have to write it the same
[174:47.20]way in this here dotpane and then return
[174:50.80]w okay
[174:53.27]let's go to the next line
[174:55.92]and create a constant called editors
[174:58.96]editors equals
[175:02.08]a dictionary and then let's use or
[175:04.96]create an html key html and map this key
[175:08.64]to editor_h HTML. So recall we have this
[175:11.76]constant eda HTML. Now we are passing
[175:14.88]this variable or using this variable as
[175:17.92]a value to this key HTML. This is a
[175:20.96]JavaScript object. Comma CSS use editor
[175:25.27]CSS comma JS
[175:29.27]that maps to edit_js or corresponds to
[175:33.04]editor js. This dictionary or this
[175:36.80]JavaScript object helps us to access
[175:40.31]these constants quickly and in a quick
[175:43.68]manner by just referencing the editors
[175:47.43]object and then accessing these
[175:49.43]properties. So rather than referencing
[175:52.47]the editor CSS, we can just reference
[175:55.43]editors CSS and we can quickly access
[175:58.56]that object.
[176:00.72]Then let's create a function called
[176:03.12]active pane. This function active pane
[176:06.56]will take nothing from me but it will
[176:09.27]instantiate a new constant called t
[176:12.72]equals so tab. T is short for tab and
[176:16.24]then use the single dollar sign function
[176:19.43]and pass to here the hash the ID web
[176:22.80]tabs and then tab.active.
[176:28.31]So here we simply we are simply
[176:30.47]accessing the web tabs here the web tabs
[176:35.35]this div which has an id of web tabs.
[176:38.64]Then inside this div we have a child
[176:41.52]with a tab class. So class we have three
[176:44.64]buttons button class tab button class
[176:47.35]tab button class tab. And each of these
[176:50.08]buttons uh and one of these buttons will
[176:53.35]have the class tab the class active. So
[176:56.24]whichever button from these buttons that
[176:58.31]have the class active I want to select
[177:00.80]it and grab it here and then return
[177:04.24]return this tab. So if this tab exists
[177:08.72]if this tab really exists then return
[177:11.60]t.deet.pane
[177:14.31]please return the name of the of the
[177:17.27]active pane whether it was HTML or CSS
[177:20.31]or JavaScript. So whichever active tab
[177:24.39]please return the name of it else return
[177:27.12]HTML. So by default if there is no any
[177:30.00]active tab by default it will be HTML.
[177:33.92]Then uh we have closed this function as
[177:35.84]this. Okay. So this function all this
[177:38.39]function does is that it returns the
[177:41.12]active pane. It creates a constant. It
[177:44.72]creates a constant called T. then it
[177:46.72]fetches the active tab whether it was
[177:49.60]HTML, CSS or JavaScript. So if the let's
[177:54.16]assume that now now we have the CSS
[177:56.47]active. So CSS then return this tab. So
[178:00.72]if this tab exists return T dot
[178:03.76]defit.pane. So the pane property here is
[178:07.43]if you scroll to the left the pane
[178:09.68]property is what? CSS. Then it will
[178:13.43]return in here CSS. But otherwise if
[178:17.27]there is no any active tab for example
[178:20.47]the active tab here is nothing. So if
[178:23.04]there is no T else it will return what?
[178:25.92]HTML. So automatically it will be the
[178:29.35]active tab will be HTML.
[178:32.00]This is the uh the logic behind this
[178:34.47]function. This function active pane
[178:36.56]returns whichever active tab it was
[178:39.43]whether it was HTML, CSS or JavaScript.
[178:42.31]Now let's create a function
[178:45.35]called show pane. Okay, show pane. Then
[178:49.92]it takes from me name one parameter
[178:52.72]name. Let's use our tab order. Let's
[178:56.16]reference tab order. This constant
[178:59.43]contains the tab order HTML CSS
[179:02.16]JavaScript. A simple array of these
[179:04.39]values. And this tab order array let's
[179:08.00]call a for each method on it dot for
[179:10.64]each
[179:12.16]and then pass a k
[179:14.96]and then use a an arrow function pass a
[179:17.27]key to an arrow function and then if
[179:20.80]wraps so if wraps at index k at index k
[179:26.31]then after this parenthesis let's get
[179:28.39]out of this parenthesis and do wraps at
[179:31.20]index key dot hidden should be equal to
[179:35.52]K
[179:37.35]does not equal. So let's put here a
[179:39.68]parenthesis a parenthesis uh K doesn't
[179:42.96]equal
[179:44.96]name semicolon. So here this is an an
[179:48.96]arrow function that contains a simple if
[179:51.52]condition simply if wraps at index k if
[179:55.60]there's wraps at index k exists then
[179:59.20]return do the following.
[180:03.12]Okay,
[180:05.60]which is wraps at index k dot hidden set
[180:08.88]the hidden property to be k doesn't
[180:12.16]equal name and then put semicolon. This
[180:15.20]is for each for each tab order uh for
[180:18.64]each element in the tab order constant.
[180:21.27]Then let's create a double or let's
[180:24.96]leverage the double dollar sign function
[180:27.12]and then pass into here the ID web tabs
[180:31.92]dot tab dot for each let's loop for each
[180:37.04]element in the tab. So for each tab for
[180:39.20]each tab of the tabs that we have
[180:41.60]available in our code editor let's pass
[180:44.00]a t parameter and then do a arrow
[180:47.27]function. Let's create a constant called
[180:50.24]on equals t dot data set dotpane
[180:55.27]equals equals equals name. So this
[180:58.64]constant on will check if the pane
[181:01.92]equals the name returned by here. So if
[181:05.68]this name equals the data set pane
[181:08.56]whether it was HTML, CSS or JS depending
[181:11.27]on the active then t.class class list
[181:16.00]dot toggle let's toggle the active comma
[181:20.08]on comma on okay and then let's do t dot
[181:24.24]set attribute let's set the attribute
[181:27.20]this function in JavaScript set
[181:28.80]attribute sets an attribute of the HTML
[181:31.84]element using JavaScript do so we have
[181:34.24]in JavaScript document object model
[181:37.12]controls the HTML elements via
[181:39.43]JavaScript this method set attribute It
[181:43.27]sets a specified attribute of a
[181:45.84]specified or or of a particular HTML
[181:48.88]element using this method set attribute
[181:51.43]and then we have to pass into here the
[181:53.60]name of the attribute area selected. So
[181:56.56]recall this property area selected by
[182:00.08]default. Now currently the HTML pane or
[182:03.20]the HTML tab is the is the selected
[182:05.92]pane. So here area selected equals true
[182:09.35]and the rest CSS and JS are what are
[182:12.47]false they don't they are not selected
[182:14.80]they are not selected let's set this
[182:17.12]property area selected to be what to be
[182:20.72]on so on here will be basically what
[182:24.47]will be true then let's go t dot tab
[182:29.68]index let's set the tab index to equal
[182:32.96]if on exists then let the value be zero
[182:37.12]So if the on exists if if it's true then
[182:40.72]set the tab index here as zero for the
[182:44.24]CSS or for the JavaScript. Okay, tab
[182:48.08]index as zero otherwise let it be minus
[182:51.35]one
[182:53.12]and then let's put here a semicolon.
[182:56.31]So all this function is doing is as the
[182:59.04]following
[183:00.64]when we click on this code edit in here
[183:04.16]code edit. Okay. And go to the wrapper
[183:08.56]here. The you can see here a scroller as
[183:12.24]controller.
[183:14.16]Go to the above side. Here we have this
[183:16.24]editor wrap. Okay. Editor wrap. Once we
[183:19.04]click on CSS
[183:21.35]note there is some changes here. We have
[183:24.47]setting the HTML to be what to be
[183:26.39]hidden. Before HTML wasn't hidden but
[183:29.76]once we click on CSS the HTML will be
[183:32.64]will be hidden. And then the CSS here
[183:35.43]you can see this div id edited CSS will
[183:39.43]have a class of ace Dracula and a class
[183:43.12]of ace dark. If you go inside this div
[183:46.88]it will be activated. So the tab index
[183:49.68]will be activated. And if you go into
[183:51.92]the top here and the tabs we have div
[183:55.04]class tabs. You can see here the tab
[183:57.27]index when we activate HTML the tab
[184:00.00]index of the HTML will be zero. But when
[184:02.80]we activate the CSS
[184:05.27]HTML becomes minus one while CSS becomes
[184:08.80]what becomes zero. So now here we are
[184:11.35]changing that attribute by setting the
[184:13.43]attribute area selected to true and also
[184:17.04]changing the active to be true and
[184:20.64]changing the tab index property to equal
[184:23.68]zero if if on exists otherwise it will
[184:26.56]be what minus one.
[184:29.52]Let's move on to the next function. Here
[184:32.39]we have request. This function request
[184:35.12]animation frame. So this function
[184:37.92]applies an animation uh without the need
[184:41.35]to reload the page. So without needing
[184:43.76]to reload the page, it applies a quick
[184:46.39]animation. Request animation frame and
[184:48.96]then it takes from me an arrow function.
[184:51.52]Let's use an arrow function inside it.
[184:54.00]Let's insert it a constant editor equals
[184:56.64]editors and then pass into here the
[184:59.43]name. Okay. And then if if this editor
[185:02.80]and editor dot resize
[185:07.52]then editor resize we have to pass into
[185:11.60]here the true. So we have to
[185:13.20]editor.resize true and also editor focus
[185:16.64]we have to focus on the editor by
[185:18.31]passing here nothing. So we have this
[185:21.20]request animation frame
[185:24.31]after this after this request animation
[185:26.88]frame function and also after this
[185:29.20]function which is show pane we have to
[185:32.08]get out of it and
[185:34.80]and call the element ID web taps by
[185:39.27]leveraging the single dollar sign
[185:41.68]function web taps and then checking
[185:44.88]whether this element exists or not. If
[185:47.84]it exists, do the following. Add event
[185:50.64]listener. We have to add an event
[185:52.56]listener. A listener that that listens
[185:54.72]for event for events. And then this
[185:57.20]event is as click. So this listener will
[186:00.16]listen for the click events. And it will
[186:02.80]do the following. It will pass into here
[186:05.43]an e parameter. So the event and it will
[186:08.47]do the following. Constant btn equals
[186:12.00]e.target
[186:13.60]dot closest. Here we have to write close
[186:16.47]cest. So note close cest and pass into
[186:19.92]here thetab class.
[186:23.12]Then if
[186:25.35]there is no btn if this btn doesn't
[186:28.96]exist then return nothing and get out of
[186:32.39]this function.
[186:34.64]Well otherwise show pane. Let's call
[186:37.60]this function this little nice function
[186:40.31]show pane. Okay, let's call it and pass
[186:43.60]into here btn dod data set dot pane. So
[186:48.96]this add event listener when we click on
[186:52.88]this webtaps ID element this element
[186:55.60]that has the the web tabs ID this
[186:57.92]listener will listen for the clicks
[186:59.60]events and then do the following. It
[187:01.60]will perform the following function. an
[187:03.68]arrow function that takes event and then
[187:06.72]it will instantiate a constant as the
[187:09.12]name btn and then e.target target dot
[187:12.31]closest pass into here the tab class and
[187:15.68]then checks if there is no a bit if
[187:18.39]there is is if there isn't bin element
[187:21.68]by putting exclamation mark so the
[187:24.72]negative operator if there is no any bit
[187:27.76]return nothing and get out of this
[187:29.27]function otherwise call and trigger this
[187:32.80]function show pane by passing it here
[187:35.27]the the name which is the name of the
[187:38.00]exam which is in this case btn That's
[187:40.88]it.pane. Let's move on to the next
[187:43.27]section which is webtabs. Let's select
[187:46.88]the web tabs element also again web tabs
[187:49.84]by using the ID hash webtabs. Then let's
[187:54.47]use the uh ex question mark to to for
[187:59.68]safe selection. If this element does
[188:02.00]exist, it will not throw an error.
[188:05.12]Otherwise, it will perform the
[188:06.88]following. Add event listener. Let's
[188:09.92]listen for the event which is in this
[188:11.68]case key down and do the following. Pass
[188:15.04]an E parameter here to the arrow
[188:17.35]function and then constant idx. IDX is
[188:20.56]short for index. Then let's go tab
[188:22.96]order. Let's reference the tab order
[188:25.43]constant dot index of this function will
[188:28.80]return the index of the matched element.
[188:31.76]So it will perform a search over this
[188:34.39]array. And if this if if the past
[188:38.39]element matches any of these elements,
[188:41.76]it will return basically return the
[188:44.72]index of that element. So return the
[188:48.24]index of and then pass to here active
[188:50.80]pane.
[188:52.31]Okay, this function active pane and then
[188:56.00]if e dot key equals equals equals arrow
[189:00.47]left. So arrow arrow left
[189:04.64]or let's put the or operator. So if the
[189:07.12]E do key if the key equals arrow left
[189:09.76]the arrow left key on your keyboard or
[189:12.80]E. If it equals or matches the arrow
[189:17.60]right so the arrow right button on your
[189:21.20]keyboard. Then create a constant delta
[189:24.64]equals E. Equals equals equals arrow
[189:29.92]left arrow left
[189:32.56]otherw uh if it equals arrow left then
[189:34.88]make the value as minus one otherwise
[189:37.43]make it as one and then call the
[189:40.08]function show pane we have to call it
[189:42.24]trigger it and pass into here the tab
[189:44.39]order
[189:46.56]and index on the the the following let's
[189:50.00]pass here a parenthesis and then idx
[189:52.88]plus delta plus tab order plus tab order
[189:59.20]uh dotlength. We have to to get the
[190:01.20]length of it. Then let's after this
[190:04.56]parenthesis put a percentage sign
[190:08.16]percentage sign and then perform a modul
[190:11.92]operator on the tab order or or the
[190:15.84]modulus the modulus operator on the tab
[190:18.31]order dotlength. So here we we are
[190:21.43]basically taking the remaining of the
[190:24.00]division between uh we don't need
[190:26.39]semicolon here basically we are tending
[190:29.68]we are getting the remaining of the
[190:32.24]division operation of this idx so the
[190:35.20]index plus delta then uh which is either
[190:39.20]minus one or one so delta is either
[190:42.24]minus one or one when we add delta to
[190:45.04]the idx and then sum with the tab o
[190:49.04]length so we are summing with the length
[190:50.72]of the tab order then we are dividing by
[190:53.52]the length of the tab order but here we
[190:55.76]are not dividing we are taking the
[190:57.84]modulus so the remaining of the division
[191:00.72]operation so every mathematical
[191:02.88]operation has a division here if you go
[191:05.27]to the console and do the following if
[191:07.76]you if we go to 9 / 3 equals what three
[191:12.72]so if you do 9 modulus 3 it will be what
[191:17.35]one
[191:19.43]So if you if you do nine modulus so
[191:22.39]modulus three here we have zero this is
[191:25.04]9 and three okay again 9 / 3 is three
[191:30.16]what is the remaining of this division
[191:32.56]zero how do we know that if you go 9
[191:35.92]modulus three we have zero
[191:39.84]but if we have for example 10 divided by
[191:42.39]three and we all know that and we all
[191:44.72]know that 10 doesn't divide equally by
[191:48.88]Three we have some remaining some
[191:51.92]remaining parts. If we take the modulus
[191:54.72]operator modulus 3 we have the remaining
[191:58.08]as what one.
[192:01.27]So here we are taking the remaining of
[192:03.92]the division operation between idx plus
[192:06.96]delta plus tab order length and then
[192:10.16]taking the remaining by dividing this
[192:12.80]part on this part which is the length of
[192:15.52]tab order. Let's move on to the next
[192:18.31]section which is here. Let's just
[192:20.96]trigger this function show pane and pass
[192:23.43]here html.
[192:26.08]Okay. So uh by calling show pane and
[192:30.24]passing HTML we are now calling that
[192:33.12]function of this show pane function
[192:36.24]which is here
[192:38.56]this show pane and letting JavaScript go
[192:41.76]through all this uh go through all this
[192:44.00]logic.
[192:45.92]Now let's move on to the next section.
[192:50.24]Now let's write the function function
[192:53.27]name it as build web src doc and then
[192:59.27]pass into here with tests parameter or
[193:03.27]argument equals true set as true
[193:08.96]or set as false. Let's instantiate is
[193:12.00]with false. So we want to instantiate
[193:13.84]the width tests parameter as false. Then
[193:17.52]let's create a constant HTML equals
[193:20.96]editor HTML. So use or reference the
[193:25.20]editor HTML dot get value function and
[193:30.56]then two empty parenthesis. Then create
[193:33.68]another constant called CSS equals
[193:36.64]editor CSS. So now we are referencing
[193:39.76]the editor CSS constant which is here if
[193:42.88]you recall the editor CSS this constant
[193:46.64]make editor and then let's call the dot
[193:51.12]get value function
[193:53.84]so note the capital V get value the same
[193:57.04]goes for the JavaScript so constant JS
[194:00.72]equals editor_js
[194:02.96]dot get value and then we have this
[194:05.76]function method get value being called
[194:09.20]on the editor.js.
[194:11.76]Let's create another constant called
[194:14.31]tests that equals let's use or leverage
[194:17.60]the single dollar sign function and pass
[194:20.96]into here the ID as test area
[194:25.12]and then use the question mark operator
[194:27.92]which checks whether this element exists
[194:30.39]in the web page or not. If it exists
[194:32.96]then we're we're good to go. dot value
[194:36.88]or just be an empty string. Then let's
[194:40.64]do dot trim function parenthesis. So the
[194:44.16]trim function will trim whatever the
[194:47.60]value that returns from here. Whether
[194:50.16]it's the value of the element or this
[194:52.23]empty string. If it's this value of this
[194:54.56]element, then it will trim it. If it's
[194:56.80]this empty string, it will trim nothing.
[194:59.27]Then return the following. Return tilda.
[195:02.56]open two tilders and write into here the
[195:06.88]document the base code for the document
[195:09.60]of the web page. So this code editor
[195:12.00]here if you go to this code editor then
[195:15.27]it will when we write here some codes
[195:18.31]for example H2 note that this is it's
[195:20.72]this is just H2 element if you write
[195:23.20]into here hello world then run with this
[195:26.64]you can see that here we have just hello
[195:29.04]world but it embeds or it inserts the
[195:32.80]base HTML code which is the dock type
[195:35.43]HTML HTML head and body. So we do we
[195:39.27]don't have to write this code here. We
[195:41.27]don't have to write document type HTML
[195:44.72]then specify
[195:46.80]in here the HTML opening tag and head.
[195:49.76]So we don't have to write that. So
[195:51.27]instead we will put it here by default
[195:55.12]and we will insert the HTML that we
[195:58.16]wrote that we write into here. We will
[196:00.31]insert it into inside into the body. So
[196:03.52]let's go document type doc type HTML. So
[196:08.80]so now we are specifying the document
[196:10.56]type as HTML. Then open the HTML tag.
[196:14.16]Specify the language as en English. Then
[196:18.00]direction as left to right. So this is
[196:21.20]the opening HTML tag and we can close
[196:23.43]that into here. inside this HTML tag or
[196:26.80]inside this HTML
[196:28.88]element, let's open a head element or a
[196:31.92]head tag and let's close that head. So
[196:34.31]the head element will contain the meta
[196:38.16]character set equals with F8. So the
[196:41.68]default or the most popular type of
[196:46.16]encoding that encodes or supports every
[196:48.96]single character is UTF8 meta character
[196:52.47]set UTF8 and also we need the meta name
[196:57.12]viewport that will allow our page to be
[197:00.31]displayed in a mobile friendly way. Then
[197:02.88]set the content equals width
[197:06.64]equals device-width
[197:10.16]semicolon and then initial initial dash.
[197:16.08]Let's put a comma here. Okay. Then
[197:17.92]initial. So a comma initial dash scale
[197:21.68]equals 1.0. Then close that string and
[197:24.80]then close this element. So the metaame
[197:27.04]viewport will ensure that our web page
[197:29.52]will be rendered in a mobile friendly
[197:31.84]way. So as you can see metame viewport
[197:35.84]content width equals device-width,
[197:39.12]initial scale equals 1. So this is the
[197:41.52]the most popular value. Then let's
[197:45.76]instantiate the the style element.
[197:48.39]Inside this style as you can infer we
[197:52.08]will paste here whatever we write in
[197:55.04]CSS. So if you make the color for
[197:57.84]example blue and run with tests then the
[198:01.04]color here will be blue. So we want to
[198:03.92]embed this styling inside the head
[198:07.04]section specifically or particularly
[198:10.00]inside the style element. So here we
[198:12.47]have the variable CSS
[198:15.92]that we got from here. Recall that we
[198:18.31]have this variable CSS. So this so the
[198:21.35]so these constants will fetch will grab
[198:24.88]the content of the editor whether it was
[198:27.76]HTML or CSS or JavaScript. So dot get
[198:31.12]value remember get value. This method
[198:34.39]gets the value of the code editor and
[198:38.64]grabs that that content whether it was
[198:40.80]HTML or CSS and stores them inside these
[198:43.76]constants. Then we can safely put or
[198:46.88]print the CSS inside this style element.
[198:49.35]Then put a back slashn to new on to go
[198:52.56]on a new on a new on a new line. Then we
[198:55.84]can make this /st style then slash head
[198:58.96]like that. We can do it like this. Then
[199:02.80]move on to the body element. So body
[199:05.12]element then slash body element. Inside
[199:08.16]the body element as you know we will put
[199:10.64]the HTML. So here html tag will go or
[199:14.16]the HTML uh constant that we got from
[199:17.04]here. So const HTML name it as HTML
[199:21.27]equals editor HTML.get value. This
[199:24.64]method retrieves the HTML and then
[199:28.16]prints it inside the body tag. And also
[199:30.64]we need to open a script tag. Script tag
[199:34.72]then /cript tag. inside this script tag
[199:38.72]let's embed or let's insert the
[199:41.12]JavaScript which is simply this constant
[199:45.20]this constant which is JS. So
[199:48.72]knowing that the JavaScript if there is
[199:51.43]an error if there's an error in
[199:53.35]JavaScript then it will throw that error
[199:56.80]and it will break our system. So our
[199:59.27]system will break if we have an error in
[200:01.84]the JavaScript. For example, if we have
[200:04.23]some here some errors in the Java in the
[200:06.96]JavaScript, then note our system won't
[200:10.56]break, but rather it will just display
[200:13.43]an error in the console saying that
[200:15.68]catch effect whatever is in here isn't
[200:19.20]defined. So if you write in here for
[200:20.72]example JavaScript and then run, it will
[200:23.92]tell us that JavaScript isn't defined is
[200:26.96]not defined because this is really isn't
[200:29.60]a variable or isn't a function. So in
[200:31.92]order to do this nice behavior, this
[200:34.72]smooth behavior, rather than breaking
[200:36.72]our system, uh causing issues, causing
[200:39.68]some breaking alerts, let's just embed
[200:43.68]the JavaScript into a try block. So
[200:46.88]let's try and execute and execute the
[200:52.00]JavaScript. And if everything goes well,
[200:54.96]if everything is good to go, then that's
[200:57.92]all right.
[200:59.92]We can do the following which is with
[201:02.72]tests the with tests parameter and and
[201:06.47]tests then question mark this is a
[201:10.08]turnary operator that checks a shorthand
[201:13.76]conditions then we can put open in here
[201:16.96]tilda put a back slash n then slash star
[201:22.80]then tests
[201:24.80]star slash then put a backslash in. So
[201:27.43]this is a comment
[201:29.35]tests in JavaScript. Then back slashn
[201:31.84]new line. So back slashn inserts a new
[201:35.20]line. Then we have to write in here the
[201:38.80]curly brackets and write into here
[201:40.39]tests.
[201:42.39]Otherwise let's
[201:46.08]return empty string. So here we are
[201:50.56]trying to execute our JavaScript code
[201:53.12]and then we are checking if with tests
[201:55.76]if it's if it's true if it exists and
[201:58.88]tests then return the tests otherwise
[202:02.39]return empty string. If you don't have
[202:05.60]tests it will return it will return
[202:08.56]empty string. If you do have tests it
[202:11.68]will return the tests and this prefix
[202:15.04]which is the tests. And then let's do a
[202:17.60]catch
[202:19.12]catch e error. So if there's an error in
[202:22.72]the javascript, let's catch it using the
[202:25.35]catch block and then pass e as the
[202:27.84]error. Then let's go console.log as we
[202:31.20]said we don't need or we don't know we
[202:34.00]don't want to break our system rather we
[202:37.68]want to print an error to the console.
[202:40.39]So console error here if you go to the
[202:43.12]console to our code here and write into
[202:46.23]here console error
[202:50.16]and then hello world for example it will
[202:56.23]declare an error in the console. So if
[202:58.88]you write console.log
[203:00.96]this will simply log some data into the
[203:03.43]console like that hello world. But if
[203:06.00]you do console. This function will
[203:09.43]publish an error or will start an error.
[203:12.64]For example, you didn't
[203:17.35]define the function.
[203:20.47]So this will publish an error or will
[203:22.80]declare an error in the console. As you
[203:24.72]can see with the red background, you
[203:26.56]didn't define the function. So we we
[203:28.80]want to declare a function here. We want
[203:30.80]to publish a an error statement console.
[203:34.72]and then pass into here the error
[203:37.12]whatever the the catched error was in
[203:40.56]the JavaScript. So whatever the user has
[203:43.04]done wrong has done wrongly in the
[203:45.35]JavaScript will be catched and will be
[203:49.12]proposed to the console as the error.
[203:51.60]Then let's
[203:53.84]type into here the
[203:58.08]so after this square bracket let's end
[204:01.04]the script like that slashcript
[204:04.08]and we need to put in here like that
[204:07.43]slash then back slashcript
[204:11.68]so like back slash and then slashcript
[204:14.31]then slashbody/html
[204:16.80]and we we of course here we want to
[204:21.27]like that. We don't need to close the
[204:22.88]tilda there. So like that. Here we have
[204:25.04]console error error. Then put a
[204:28.64]backslash to escape the slash uh sign
[204:33.04]then slashcript then slashbody and then
[204:35.92]close the HTML. And here you can see we
[204:38.56]have this error expected
[204:43.84]colon.
[204:45.84]I think we need yeah we don't need this
[204:48.31]semicolon here. and
[204:52.00]expected like this untinated template
[204:54.80]literal.
[204:56.39]So we have to close
[205:00.23]this semicolon here
[205:04.88]here with tests and tests we need a
[205:07.27]question mark then tilda I think back
[205:10.31]slash n
[205:12.80]and then embed the tests then yeah we
[205:15.76]need to close the tilda here this tilda
[205:18.16]we haven't closed we've started tilda
[205:19.84]here but we haven't closed it here so we
[205:22.56]need to start a new tilda and end it
[205:25.12]here over
[205:26.31]Why? Because this is a string. This is a
[205:28.47]standalone string. Here we have a back
[205:30.56]slashn new line. Then we have this test
[205:33.27]comment. Then new line. Then we insert
[205:35.76]the tests whatever the test was. So
[205:38.23]simply what this function does is it
[205:40.96]build a web source code. It establishes
[205:44.64]the source code for for the web page
[205:47.35]that will be written by the user who
[205:49.92]uses our code editor.
[205:52.39]Here we've got the the content of the
[205:54.56]HTML. CSS, JavaScript and we embed it
[205:58.08]into the base HTML 5 code which is
[206:01.20]document type HTML HTML language English
[206:04.39]head and the metas and then we inserted
[206:06.80]the CSS inside the style as you can see
[206:09.43]and also we've inserted or embedded or
[206:11.92]appended the HTML inside the body tag
[206:14.64]and the same for the JavaScript but for
[206:16.64]the JavaScript sake as we said
[206:18.64]JavaScript is a sensitive language it's
[206:21.68]a real programming language unlike HTML
[206:25.35]or CSS and when when it contains an
[206:28.72]error it will throw that error and break
[206:31.43]our system but rather why don't we
[206:34.16]safely do a try catch block and try this
[206:38.39]code if it contains some errors then
[206:41.12]these errors will be catched and will be
[206:43.60]proposed to the console or if it doesn't
[206:46.88]contain any error then this will be
[206:49.52]executed within the script and this
[206:52.64]JavaScript will be safe to
[206:55.76]After this function, let's define
[206:57.76]another function that that says run web.
[207:01.20]So the name of the function is run web
[207:03.12]and let's here pass with tests. So the
[207:07.43]parameter or the argument with tests
[207:09.60]equals false. Let's pass here false. and
[207:13.20]then preview
[207:16.00]src doc
[207:18.64]equals let's call that function build
[207:22.16]web src doc and pass into here the with
[207:26.16]tests parameter. So recall that this
[207:30.16]function takes from me one parameter one
[207:32.88]argument called with tests capital t and
[207:36.72]this parameter is initialized is
[207:39.20]starting as a false value. We've started
[207:42.23]it or we've initialized with a false
[207:44.16]value. And now we have passed to it this
[207:47.52]parameter with tests. We've passed it to
[207:50.23]this function build web src doc. Then
[207:53.20]let's go log
[207:55.68]function and pass into here with tests
[207:58.31]this with test parameter. If it's true
[208:01.20]then return run with tests otherwise
[208:05.60]return web preview
[208:09.76]updated. So this is a turnary operator.
[208:13.76]This is a turnary operator in
[208:15.20]JavaScript. It checks for whether the
[208:18.56]width tests is true or not. If it's
[208:21.20]true, then return run with tests. If
[208:24.96]it's not true, if it's false like the
[208:27.68]default, now the default is false. So
[208:30.80]the default behavior is it will return
[208:33.12]this value web preview updated.
[208:36.39]So based on the width test parameter it
[208:39.27]will return one of these two strings.
[208:41.52]This is the run. This is the run web
[208:43.60]function. And recall that run web
[208:45.68]function when we click control enter in
[208:50.16]Windows or if you have Mac if you uh
[208:53.20]click command enter then or if you press
[208:56.56]command enter then it will execute this
[208:58.80]function which is run web and this
[209:01.12]function
[209:03.35]by default will execute this function
[209:05.68]build web srcdc do this function and
[209:08.88]this function will do the following
[209:11.27]instantiate or establishes the base HTML
[209:14.72]5 code and inserts the CSS, HTML and
[209:18.23]JavaScript into the into the respective
[209:21.35]places. Now let's move on to the next
[209:23.68]which is using our dollar sign variable
[209:26.00]and pass into here the rune hash run
[209:29.84]web. So we want to select this element
[209:32.16]with the id run web and then the save
[209:36.08]selection which is question mark dot add
[209:38.96]event add event listener.
[209:42.64]If there is an uh if this element exists
[209:45.52]then we want to listen for the click
[209:47.76]elements for the click events then we
[209:50.23]want to listen for the click events and
[209:52.56]do the following. We want to execute the
[209:55.43]run web function and pass into here
[209:57.76]false. So here all all we're doing is we
[210:01.43]are selecting the run web element and
[210:04.72]then we are selecting it in a safe mode
[210:07.35]question mark dot add event listener
[210:10.72]will listen for every single event
[210:13.92]click events and run this function or
[210:16.56]trigger this function run web with the
[210:18.72]default behavior false.
[210:21.27]The same goes for the run tests. So
[210:24.47]let's select the run tests element
[210:27.60]safely question mark dot add event
[210:31.04]listener listener
[210:34.16]add event listener
[210:36.31]I think I have a typo in here add event
[210:38.80]listener like that and then click when
[210:43.04]we click on the run test button we have
[210:45.84]to execute this function which is run
[210:48.56]with but this time
[210:51.12]passed here true. So if you want if you
[210:54.39]want to run the web if you want to run
[210:56.64]the code in these tabs but in tests mode
[211:00.47]like in here run with tests. So we have
[211:03.43]some tests okay then we have to pass
[211:06.16]into here true. Why? Because the
[211:08.64]parameter with tests equals will be
[211:11.68]true. So this true will overwrite this
[211:14.47]true will overwrite over the false. But
[211:18.31]if you don't if you want the default
[211:20.72]behavior which is without tests we can
[211:23.35]pass into here false. So it will be run
[211:27.60]or it will run without any tests.
[211:30.88]And this is the default behavior. After
[211:33.04]that let's select now use the dollar
[211:36.08]sign and select the element open
[211:39.68]preview. Open preview.
[211:42.80]Okay. So now we are selecting this
[211:44.96]element open preview using the id open
[211:47.52]preview and then let's put question mark
[211:50.72]dot add event listener
[211:54.16]add event listener and then listen for
[211:56.39]the click events for the clicks. So as
[211:58.88]you can see the add event listener
[212:00.88]method of event target uh of the event
[212:03.68]target interface sets up a function that
[212:06.64]will be called whenever the specified
[212:08.96]event is delivered to the target. Then
[212:11.60]comma let's call this function this
[212:14.80]error function which will instantiate a
[212:16.96]constant called src source equals build
[212:21.27]web source doc this function and pass
[212:25.04]into here false
[212:28.16]then also let's insert a constant or or
[212:30.80]create a constant that's named w equals
[212:34.00]window open and also pass into here
[212:37.35]about blank. So if you notice before
[212:40.88]when we click on open preview it will
[212:43.20]open the it will open the project in a
[212:46.31]new window and it says here about blank.
[212:49.04]So it opens it in a new window in a new
[212:51.84]browser window. So to do that we we need
[212:54.23]to insert it a window by going con W. W
[212:57.76]is short for window. So if you don't
[213:00.39]know what W is W is short for window.
[213:03.43]Then we have window open a new window
[213:06.72]about blank. And then we can go
[213:09.20]w.doccument.open.
[213:11.84]We want to open that window. Then we
[213:14.56]want to w do.cument dot write. We want
[213:18.96]to document write. We want to write the
[213:22.88]src the source which is coming from this
[213:25.60]function. Recall that this function
[213:27.92]build src web it returns
[213:32.56]all of this delta tilda which contains
[213:35.76]the base HTML code with the CSS with the
[213:38.56]HTML and with the JavaScript. So we have
[213:40.64]these three positions will be replaced
[213:43.12]with whatever we write in these tabs.
[213:45.76]Then these codes will be returned and
[213:49.84]stored in this constant and we will
[213:52.16]write it forcely
[213:54.39]on this W window. Then also let's go W
[213:58.16]dot document
[214:00.16]dot close. Let's close. Finally, let's
[214:04.08]close the so close the window to prevent
[214:08.64]losing
[214:10.56]resources. So if you do not close this
[214:13.12]window it will be opened and it will
[214:16.00]consume resources like computing
[214:18.23]resources. Then let's close that
[214:20.64]function using semicolon. Now let's dive
[214:24.16]into the function of uh of project JSON.
[214:28.31]So project JSON this function will
[214:31.52]return simply return a dictionary or I
[214:35.60]would say JavaScript object then version
[214:39.92]one. So this is the the first version of
[214:42.39]this app. If you modify it later, you
[214:44.56]can put here 1.1 for example six or two.
[214:49.43]So now it's version one. Then let's put
[214:51.76]here kind as web only. Web only. So this
[214:56.56]this is the type of code. It's just web
[214:59.12]only. web only. Then assignment
[215:04.88]as let's use our dollar sign function
[215:08.08]and pass to here assignment
[215:12.16]and then let's put question mark dot
[215:15.04]value or just simply make it as a empty
[215:19.60]string. So we need to select this
[215:22.64]assignment text area element here.
[215:25.68]Recall the ID equals assignment. This
[215:29.60]element is a text area element. So we
[215:32.39]have here a text area inside the assign
[215:34.88]element. We have a text area element
[215:37.04]with ID of assignment. We want to select
[215:39.68]that element using the the single dollar
[215:42.23]assign function and then get the value
[215:44.56]dot value or otherwise if there's
[215:47.35]nothing let's put an empty string. Then
[215:49.76]test let's assect or choose the element
[215:54.16]test area dot value let's put here
[215:57.84]question mark dot value or otherwise
[216:01.04]let's put here an or operator which is
[216:03.27]double pipe so double pipe signs and
[216:06.31]then put empty string
[216:08.88]HTML let's get the editor HTML dot get
[216:13.04]value function
[216:15.84]the same for CSS let's go editor CSS
[216:19.35]dot get value function and also
[216:23.27]JavaScript. Let's go edit_js.get
[216:27.35]value function or method so we can get
[216:29.76]the value. And lastly, let's close that
[216:33.20]or end that object with a semicolon. So
[216:36.56]all this function does project JSON or
[216:39.52]project JSON, it returns a JavaScript uh
[216:43.12]a JavaScript object of these keys mapped
[216:46.23]to these values. Version one kind whip
[216:49.12]only assignment as the assignment uh
[216:52.23]element or target uh target the
[216:54.72]assignment element and gets the value
[216:57.04]test area gets the value of test area
[216:59.60]and edit HTML edit the CSS edit JSO get
[217:03.35]value method to get the value of those
[217:05.43]editors then let's create a function
[217:08.80]called load project this function will
[217:12.08]take from me objects so this object will
[217:15.12]be returned by this function and will be
[217:17.35]passed to this function load project se
[217:21.12]sequentially. Then we have a try block
[217:23.92]that will try the following. So a try
[217:26.16]and catch block is popular in in in
[217:29.43]programming. Try tries the following
[217:32.00]block of code and if it can if it
[217:33.92]contains any error it will be catched
[217:36.56]via the catch later. So catch error
[217:39.12]later. Here inside the try let's put if
[217:43.12]assignment let's choose the assignment
[217:46.47]element and then let's go
[217:51.27]assignment
[217:53.60]then if there's an assignment element
[217:56.56]get that assignment element like that.
[217:59.12]So here I have assignment with hash sign
[218:02.23]hash assignment like this and then dot
[218:05.60]value let's set the value for it to
[218:07.84]equal object dot assignment. So now we
[218:11.20]have this object which is this JS object
[218:15.43]and then we are getting or we are
[218:17.35]accessing the assignment key. So to
[218:20.31]access a key from inside a JavaScript
[218:23.04]object we use the dot notation. So we
[218:25.20]use the dot notation dot assignment to
[218:27.68]access this assignment key or assignment
[218:30.64]map or just return nothing
[218:34.80]then semicolon. The same goes here. If
[218:38.00]if there is an if there is an element as
[218:40.47]the following if there's this element
[218:42.39]which is hash id test area then
[218:47.43]select this element test area dot value
[218:51.60]and set the value to it or you have to
[218:54.47]change the value by the following object
[218:57.27]dot access the test
[219:01.04]key which is this key dot test this this
[219:03.68]this is the key that we have to access
[219:06.08]object dot test then or
[219:09.76]leave it as empty string and then
[219:12.16]editor_html
[219:13.84]dot set value the method set value pass
[219:17.27]into here object
[219:19.35]HTML or nothing in case there's nothing
[219:23.43]because maybe there's no any HTML so
[219:26.08]maybe we don't want any HTML but we just
[219:28.72]need to code some CSS here you can see
[219:32.23]CSS for example background as red then
[219:36.00]we can run that and that is correct.
[219:39.60]Maybe we don't need any HTML. Some
[219:42.64]projects don't do not include any HTML.
[219:45.60]The same case for CSS. Some projects
[219:48.31]just have HTML but without any CSS
[219:52.47]and also without any JavaScript. So you
[219:54.96]can do that and it will be valid. How?
[219:58.00]By retaining empty values. Then
[220:00.64]semicolon and then editor CSS dot set
[220:04.56]value. Let's set a value by going object
[220:08.00]CSS or just return nothing.
[220:14.72]And also to move the cursor to the
[220:18.47]specified position, we have to pass into
[220:21.35]here minus one. So let's specify here
[220:24.31]minus one for all over here. So the set
[220:26.64]value takes from me the value and then
[220:29.20]the cursor position. Also editor_js dot
[220:33.12]set value. we we want to set the value
[220:35.76]of the edit js by passing the object js
[220:40.00]and then or just return nothing comma
[220:43.04]minus one. Okay. So now we are setting
[220:46.16]the value of the js by passing the
[220:48.96]object js or nothing comma minus one.
[220:54.00]Then let's go ahead and log the
[220:58.00]following string. So the message recall
[221:00.39]the log function here above. So log this
[221:03.76]function log this function will take
[221:05.84]from me a message and the type of this
[221:08.23]message whether it was info or error or
[221:11.60]warning and if it was error it will use
[221:14.31]this error uh this error color. If it
[221:16.96]was warning it will employ this warning
[221:19.76]color otherwise it will leverage this
[221:22.23]color. Okay, let's go down and log this
[221:27.35]message web project loaded. And what is
[221:32.08]the type of this of this message? Well,
[221:34.16]the type of this message is by default
[221:36.96]here it is info. So this tab message is
[221:41.84]by default type equals info. By default,
[221:44.56]it's an information type of
[221:47.43]messagesformational.
[221:50.00]It's not error. It's not considered a
[221:52.16]warning. Then let's close with a
[221:53.60]semicolon
[221:55.52]catch. If there's an error in all of
[221:58.00]this code, so we want to try and run
[222:00.39]this code. If this block of code
[222:02.88]contains any kind of error, then let's
[222:05.68]catch it by going log and then unable.
[222:10.88]Let's write here unable
[222:13.76]to load project project
[222:19.35]then plus the error to inform us or to
[222:22.39]tell us what is the error that's been
[222:24.64]catched
[222:27.43]or we can write here colon. So unable to
[222:29.92]load project plus error
[222:33.12]and then pass here the type of the
[222:35.68]message as error. So we want to specify
[222:38.00]to label this message that this message
[222:40.47]is a is an error message.
[222:44.08]Here you can see the log function. We
[222:46.96]can specify the type as error. And if
[222:49.68]the type equals equals equals error then
[222:52.88]use or employ or leverage this variable
[222:56.47]color that will hint that this message
[222:59.27]will be a an error message.
[223:02.64]Let's move on to this function. So
[223:05.04]function we have a function here to set
[223:08.16]default content. This function sets the
[223:11.60]default content of the web editor. It
[223:14.00]takes nothing. Then let's set the editor
[223:16.72]HTML dot set value. We have to set the
[223:19.92]value and pass into here the following
[223:22.08]tilda. Then we have to write this here.
[223:27.12]What is the default content that you
[223:28.96]want to write?
[223:31.12]For example, in this uh case, we have
[223:34.16]this default content. So maybe we can
[223:37.60]copy this content and paste it into here
[223:41.68]like that
[223:44.00]and it will be here. And also you can
[223:46.56]use whatever you want. So we can you can
[223:48.39]specify whatever content you want to put
[223:50.88]or you would like to put as the default
[223:52.96]content. Right now we do not have any
[223:55.04]content by default. But you can specify
[223:57.35]for example a comment that says
[224:02.08]write your content here. Write your HTML
[224:05.92]code here.
[224:10.08]Dot. Then let's do the following.
[224:13.52]Editor CSS. We can keep it simple. Dot
[224:16.88]set value equals or this function takes
[224:20.47]from me a tilda.
[224:23.19]Then let's put in here a comment in CSS
[224:25.76]like this. Comment in CSS. Uh comments
[224:29.12]in CSS are done by doing slashstar
[224:34.08]star slash then write into here write
[224:37.04]your CSS code here
[224:41.68]dot then the same editor_js. So this is
[224:45.35]a simple function that sets the default
[224:48.23]content for each web editor dot set
[224:51.12]value. Then we can pass into here a
[224:53.52]tilda or a simple string. Then write
[224:56.31]into here your Java in comment your
[225:00.56]JavaScript code
[225:03.76]goes here
[225:06.08]dot dot.
[225:08.00]So uh now we have the default content
[225:10.96]that will be that will go for each code
[225:14.47]editor. Then we have to to specify in
[225:16.96]here the minus one. So you have to put
[225:19.84]here minus one comma minus one and for
[225:22.56]the HTML minus one. Why? Because minus
[225:25.19]one specifies the position of the cursor
[225:28.47]that. So here you can see once we reload
[225:32.39]the position of the cursor by default is
[225:34.31]minus one. Meaning the position of the
[225:36.64]cursor will be at the beginning of the
[225:38.64]code editor. So it will start at the
[225:40.56]beginning or at the start of the code
[225:42.47]editor.
[225:44.64]So we have to pass into here minus one.
[225:46.88]This is really important.
[225:48.96]Now let's move on to this function
[225:51.12]function which is called save project.
[225:54.23]This function takes from me nothing but
[225:56.80]it does the following tries. So a try
[225:59.52]block. Let's try to create a constant
[226:02.64]called data equals JSON. So the JSON
[226:05.84]class in JavaScript dot stringify.
[226:08.72]Stringify is an is an interesting is an
[226:11.52]interesting function that will stringify
[226:14.00]any JSON object you pass to it. So it
[226:17.19]parse that JSON object by going project
[226:21.84]JSON. So this function that we have
[226:24.39]created earlier recall this function
[226:27.04]project JSON it returns a JavaScript
[226:30.00]object.
[226:31.52]Then we pass this function which is
[226:35.04]project JSON. Okay. We pass it to the
[226:38.39]stringify method. Then we have to
[226:41.19]specify here null, comma. So null is the
[226:45.12]replacer. Do you want to replacer? Then
[226:47.12]comma space equals as two
[226:51.04]semicolon.
[226:52.72]Create another or now let's do a local
[226:55.52]storage. Let's use local storage objects
[226:58.88]in JavaScript to use and leverage the
[227:01.35]local storage dot set item. Let's create
[227:04.56]a new item. So here we have in the
[227:07.52]console application you can see here we
[227:10.16]have local storage and local storage is
[227:13.12]a system in the browser that stores
[227:16.39]temporary data or stores temporary
[227:19.04]information inside the users itself
[227:22.00]browser inside the user's browser itself
[227:25.35]and this data will be removed once the
[227:28.64]user removes the cache. So once the user
[227:31.43]removes the cache data this data here
[227:33.43]will be removed. So it is considered
[227:35.60]temporary and also it is uh one of the
[227:39.04]most easy ways to store data in the web.
[227:42.88]Here we can do local local storage dot
[227:46.64]set item and pass into here a key for
[227:49.76]example my own key and then put the
[227:54.31]value as for example the color blue for
[227:58.16]example. Now if you go to the
[227:59.76]application now we have this key my own
[228:02.56]key. This is the key and the value is
[228:05.84]color blue. So you can store whatever
[228:08.39]you want. Another example local storage
[228:12.23]dot set item.
[228:14.64]For example,
[228:16.16]this tutorial
[228:19.68]is on and then the value as free code
[228:23.76]camp run application. Now we have a new
[228:26.96]key. This tutorial is on free code camp.
[228:30.16]So this is a way to store information on
[228:32.96]the web. Set item pass into here. The
[228:35.76]storage key. Recall that storage key is
[228:38.72]a simple constant that we have created
[228:40.96]earlier way back up in the in this page.
[228:44.47]Storage key and it contains some kind of
[228:47.68]string. You can name this as whatever
[228:49.35]you want. In this case, I want to name
[228:51.12]it academy codelab web. So the storage
[228:54.56]key, this is the name of the key for the
[228:57.35]local storage. comment the value is a
[228:59.68]data. So the data that we get back from
[229:02.31]the JSON we want to store it. So JSON
[229:05.35]the JSON class dot stringify and pass
[229:08.47]the function project JSON. Then let's go
[229:11.35]constant blob. Let's instantiate a blob
[229:14.64]object. New blob object. And then pass
[229:18.72]into here the uh an array of data, comma
[229:23.52]type
[229:25.12]as application
[229:27.60]/json.
[229:29.84]Okay. So here we wanted to to to define
[229:32.39]that that the type of this blob is
[229:35.12]applica application/json.
[229:37.35]It accepts JSON files. Then constant a.
[229:41.19]Let's create an element A which is
[229:43.27]anchor tag the anchor tag the popular
[229:45.52]anchor tag in the web. And then let's go
[229:48.00]document. So the document object model
[229:51.27]dot the function create element. So we
[229:54.47]want to create an element.
[229:57.35]Then pass to here a the a tag the anchor
[230:00.16]tag a. Now we have a created a element.
[230:05.43]We can manipulate this element whichever
[230:07.43]way we want. like ah href equals URL dot
[230:13.35]create object URL and pass to here the
[230:16.96]blob element. So here all all we're
[230:20.08]doing all we are doing is we are
[230:22.08]creating a new element a and then we are
[230:25.27]changing its href property to equal URL
[230:29.12]dot create object URL and passing it
[230:31.76]here the blob.
[230:34.00]Then we can go a dot download equals
[230:39.43]academy-academy
[230:42.80]web.json
[230:45.76]semicolon and also a click. We want to
[230:49.35]click on this link by default. So this
[230:51.84]is programmatically this is a
[230:54.08]programmatic a programmatic
[230:58.31]way of clicking
[231:01.52]on elements. So clicking on elements
[231:05.04]elements. So if you want to click on
[231:07.43]element programmatically we can do that
[231:09.68]easily using
[231:12.47]using the click method here. If we go to
[231:14.88]this and create a new element for
[231:17.68]example constant
[231:20.16]anchor equals document
[231:24.16]dot create
[231:26.72]element
[231:28.80]A. Then we have this element a
[231:33.19]document.
[231:36.00]Okay. So here we have document dot
[231:38.39]create element a. Now we can a.href
[231:41.60]equals for example uh google.com.
[231:48.72]Here we have anchor anchor. You can go
[231:51.19]anchor.
[231:52.72]Okay. Google.com. Now let's append this
[231:55.19]element to the body. So you can go
[231:56.47]document.body
[231:58.47]do.append. append child and pass into
[232:01.52]here the anchor tag anchor. As you can
[232:04.64]see now we have this anchor tag. Let's
[232:06.96]write into it. So anchor
[232:11.35]text txt
[232:14.23]text content equals for example Google
[232:18.23]equals Google.
[232:20.56]Okay. Then let's reappend it to the
[232:23.60]HTML. Now if you go down here we have
[232:27.68]this anchor tag. Okay. And if you want
[232:30.56]to click on it programmatically we can
[232:32.72]do that by doing anchor dotclick.
[232:37.12]It will redirect us redirect us to to
[232:39.76]Google. You can see it went to
[232:41.84]google.com. So it will redirect us
[232:44.64]automatically. Automatically we can do
[232:46.96]that by by doing click. So click this is
[232:49.84]a programmatic way of clicking on
[232:51.60]elements.
[232:55.52]Now let's log some message by going
[232:58.88]saved locally
[233:02.47]and download
[233:05.52]download
[233:07.12]uh and down uh saved locally and
[233:09.60]downloaded downloaded
[233:12.16]JSON file
[233:15.84]and here we have a catch let's catch the
[233:19.04]error catch e and pass into here log
[233:22.47]Write unable to save. So if we are
[233:27.92]unable to save plus error, print the
[233:31.12]error message, comma, let's label this
[233:33.60]message as an error message. So this
[233:35.52]message will be an error message.
[233:39.35]Now lastly, let's select our elements
[233:42.16]hash save btn dot safely using a
[233:47.12]question mark dot add event listener and
[233:50.31]listen for clicks comma
[233:53.19]save project function. So let's let's uh
[233:58.31]run the save project function when we
[234:01.12]click on this element save it in. So
[234:03.84]save bit do adde event listener and then
[234:06.72]when clicking let's run this function
[234:09.04]save project
[234:11.19]and the same goes for the load file.
[234:13.19]Let's select the load file load file
[234:16.64]element
[234:18.31]or load bn. So hash load btn question
[234:22.47]mark addvent listener
[234:26.96]click. So we want to listen for clicks.
[234:29.27]We want to listen for clicks and then
[234:31.12]when a click happens let's run this
[234:33.52]function which is selecting this element
[234:37.60]open file
[234:40.08]dotclick.
[234:43.27]So you want to click on this open file
[234:45.68]and also let's select this element open
[234:48.56]file this element which which has the ID
[234:51.27]open file and then put question mark dot
[234:54.47]add event listener
[234:57.68]and then pass to here the click event or
[235:00.64]the change let's listen for the change
[235:03.04]listen for the changes comma
[235:05.68]asynchronously let's asynchronously
[235:10.39]run this error function which takes E
[235:13.35]constant F
[235:15.84]let's create a constant F equals
[235:17.92]E.target
[235:19.52]dot files otherwise uh if it contains
[235:23.04]files then
[235:25.68]question mark return dot at index zero.
[235:31.27]Okay. Otherwise if
[235:34.31]if we don't have f. So if f doesn't
[235:37.19]exist. So if you do not have f let's go
[235:40.23]ahead and return nothing and get out of
[235:42.72]this function otherwise try let's try
[235:46.88]and do the following constant object
[235:50.72]equals JSON dotparse
[235:54.47]let's parse JSON and a weight so here
[235:58.64]pass a weight keyword await
[236:01.92]and here let's go fext let's get the
[236:05.04]text of the f and also load project.
[236:09.19]Let's call load project and pass into
[236:11.84]here the object. So the load project
[236:13.92]function is a function that we have
[236:15.76]created earlier here. Load project. It
[236:18.23]takes from me an object and it tries to
[236:22.56]get some values from that object like
[236:25.35]the HTML CSS JavaScript. it access HTML,
[236:29.27]CSS,JS from the object and if anything
[236:32.16]happens here wrongly then it will catch
[236:34.96]that error and pass a unable to find or
[236:38.96]to load project plus error and pass this
[236:42.00]to to the log function.
[236:52.39]So here let's go after the catch error.
[236:55.60]Here we have an error catch or finally
[236:58.64]expected TS. So yeah try expected catch.
[237:03.12]So catch error
[237:06.08]then we have here catch as error. Let's
[237:08.16]name it as ER r error. The variable of
[237:10.72]the error that will store the error
[237:12.88]message. Then log let's log into here
[237:15.84]invalid invalid
[237:18.72]project file,
[237:21.60]error
[237:23.12]then put semicolon. So here the log
[237:25.52]function will log the following invalid
[237:28.08]project file and then label this message
[237:30.56]as an error message.
[237:34.72]Then let's close it with a semicolon.
[237:37.19]Finally, let's do a try block. So try
[237:41.68]let's try to create a constant called
[237:44.16]cache equals local storage.get item. So
[237:49.35]this is from the cache get item and then
[237:52.16]pass to here the storage key. So if what
[237:56.00]when whenever you want to retrieve any
[237:58.16]key from here from the application you
[238:00.56]just reference the key by its name. For
[238:03.19]example, my own key here. We can
[238:05.60]reference the name of the key by going
[238:09.04]local storage
[238:12.00]local storage uh storage dot get item
[238:16.72]and then reference the name of the key
[238:19.84]it will retain the value of the key. So
[238:22.64]to get the value just reference the key
[238:25.04]of the name by going get item strud key
[238:28.80]and then if cache if there's a real
[238:31.27]cache then go ahead and load project
[238:35.60]pass into here JSON dotparse
[238:38.88]parse
[238:41.19]and pass the cache. So you want to parse
[238:43.84]the cache. Why? Because the stored
[238:46.39]values here will be JSON. So in order to
[238:51.19]parse and decompose that JSON, we have
[238:54.23]to pass that cache. So the data that has
[238:57.60]been that has been gotten from this
[238:59.76]local storage, we have to pass it
[239:01.60]through the parse function from the JSON
[239:04.00]class and parse it. Else if you do not
[239:07.19]have cache, so if cache isn't available,
[239:09.92]then set default content. So this
[239:14.39]function set default content will here
[239:18.08]we have defined it here earlier. This
[239:20.96]function
[239:25.04]here set default content it sets the
[239:27.52]default content for the HTML CSS
[239:30.72]JavaScript and it places the cursor at
[239:33.52]the first position using the minus one
[239:36.31]operator. Then let's go and put here
[239:40.39]semicolon and move on to the catch. So
[239:43.84]catch
[239:45.43]e error.
[239:47.43]This time we don't need to catch any
[239:49.27]error. So let's go ahead and set default
[239:53.92]content. So let's call or trigger that
[239:57.27]function. Set default content. Put
[239:59.60]semicolon. And lastly, let's log some
[240:02.56]message that says ready. The app now is
[240:05.76]ready. Web only. Web only editor.
[240:10.96]HTML/
[240:12.47]CSS/JavaScript
[240:15.60]JavaScript
[240:17.12]and then congratulations we have
[240:20.39]finished writing our JavaScript and here
[240:23.19]I think we have an error
[240:29.43]because the space between the question
[240:32.31]mark and the dot. Okay. So now
[240:35.04]congratulations we have finished writing
[240:37.68]our JavaScript code. As you can see
[240:41.84]this these are all of the functionality
[240:44.08]needed to build this code editor. So
[240:47.04]first we have created a helper functions
[240:50.16]two helper functions single dollar sign
[240:53.92]and double dollar sign. So the single
[240:56.47]dollar sign function will choose the
[240:58.72]first occurrence of the pass selector.
[241:01.35]The double dollar sign will choose all
[241:04.16]occurrences of all elements in the DOM
[241:07.27]or in the document. And then out
[241:09.92]leverages the single dollar sign and
[241:12.64]selects the output. The same for
[241:14.56]preview. It selects the preview element,
[241:16.64]the iframe element. And then we have
[241:18.64]this escape HTML function. This escape
[241:21.60]HTML function will escape the special
[241:24.80]sensitive characters and write them in
[241:27.84]the entity version. So rather than using
[241:30.96]them in this version, we want to convert
[241:33.76]them or map them into their respective
[241:37.35]corresponding
[241:39.04]entity versions to escape the unsafe
[241:42.16]HTML. Then we have this function called
[241:44.88]log which simply takes an a message and
[241:48.00]then the type of that message and it
[241:50.31]will display that message with a span
[241:53.35]with a with an error color or warning
[241:55.76]color depending on the type of message
[241:57.92]or it will just be a brand color. If the
[242:00.16]type is info and also it will append
[242:03.27]that child into the out as we said the
[242:05.35]out variable here is here. This is the
[242:08.16]out variable. It will append that child.
[242:10.64]And also we have a function called
[242:12.39]called clear out. This function will
[242:14.16]clear out the logs. Then we have a
[242:16.23]function called make editor. This
[242:18.23]function will set up a new editor as you
[242:20.96]can see and then configure this editor
[242:23.68]as you can see with the add command uh
[242:26.31]binding the keys control enter or
[242:28.80]command enter to run and execute this
[242:31.27]function run web with the with tests
[242:34.47]equals false. and also bind the key
[242:37.52]control S or command S to save to save
[242:40.31]the project or to save the code and it
[242:43.60]triggers this function save project. So
[242:46.23]it triggers this this function save
[242:48.56]project and it returns the configured
[242:50.96]editor and then we instantiated a new
[242:54.72]editor for each language HTML CSS
[242:58.08]JavaScript by passing here the mode as
[243:01.12]ace mode HTML as mode JavaScript ACE
[243:04.39]mode CSS and then we have here the tab
[243:07.12]order the order the order of the tabs
[243:10.00]HTML CSS JavaScript and also here we
[243:12.96]have the uh editors mapped to their keys
[243:17.04]for easy access for easy and quick
[243:19.27]access and also here you can see we are
[243:21.76]mapping through each of the windows so
[243:24.16]we here we have window wowd
[243:27.35]set.pane pane and then we are retaining
[243:29.04]the window.
[243:31.27]Then we have a function called active
[243:32.96]pane which will retain the active pane
[243:35.60]and then if there's no any active pane
[243:38.08]by default it will be HTML. Then it
[243:41.19]shows the pane using this functionality
[243:43.43]here for each toggle active and then set
[243:46.23]attribute area selected to on and as we
[243:49.76]said the request animation frame will
[243:52.64]perform some animation without needing
[243:54.72]to reload the page. And then we have
[243:56.88]this function this if if condition
[243:58.96]editor and editor resize then we have to
[244:02.08]resize true and then focus on the editor
[244:05.12]also here we have the add event listener
[244:07.60]key down which will perform a key down.
[244:10.80]If we press on the on the buttons then
[244:14.56]if the button is arrow left or arrow
[244:16.39]right then it will move that cursor by
[244:21.12]that amount. So here we have index plus
[244:23.84]delta plus tab order modulus tab
[244:27.19]order.length.
[244:28.72]Okay. So here the add event listener is
[244:31.43]listening for key down strikes on the
[244:33.68]keyboard. And here we have an add event
[244:36.39]listener for clicks. If we click on that
[244:39.27]and if there's no any button we return
[244:41.43]nothing and exit and exit out of the
[244:44.00]function. Otherwise we show the pane and
[244:47.12]we pass into here the name of the pane
[244:49.52]as btn.et.pane.
[244:51.68]pane. Then we have this function which
[244:54.31]is build web src doc. This function
[244:57.52]builds the essential or initial HTML 5
[245:00.72]codes and embeds the HTML JavaScript CSS
[245:04.80]into their respective fields or places.
[245:07.60]Then we have this function run web which
[245:09.84]will run the web uh depending on the
[245:12.88]with tests. So if you have tests then it
[245:15.68]will return this message run with test
[245:18.31]otherwise it will be web preview
[245:20.64]updated.
[245:22.23]Also we have this functionality here
[245:24.47]which is project JSON. This function
[245:26.88]returns a object. This uh this object
[245:30.80]contains some meta information about the
[245:34.00]editor like version one kind or only
[245:37.04]assignment the value of the assignment
[245:39.35]and also the value of the test area and
[245:41.43]for the HTML CSS JavaScript. Then we
[245:44.31]have this load project which will load
[245:46.56]the data and places the cursor at the
[245:49.52]first position using minus one and also
[245:52.96]set default content sets the default
[245:55.52]content of the web page. And here we
[245:57.60]also we have save project. This function
[246:00.08]deals with the saving using the JSON.
[246:02.47]Stringify. As we said, stringify parses
[246:05.68]a JSON object. Then we instantiate a new
[246:09.60]item in the local stretch named as the
[246:12.08]key stretch key and stores the data.
[246:14.88]Then we then we instantiate a new blob
[246:17.04]object. And also create a new element
[246:20.23]anchor. Set set the href to the URL. And
[246:24.08]also set the download as academy
[246:26.16]web.json. JSON and we click on it
[246:27.92]programmatically.
[246:31.04]And lastly here as we said these are all
[246:33.35]of the functionality that we have
[246:35.12]discussed earlier. So so now we need to
[246:37.60]import the ACE library. ACE library is a
[246:41.27]module in JavaScript that helps our code
[246:44.16]editor becomes
[246:46.39]fully working with interpreting the
[246:48.56]language of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. So
[246:51.84]let's go to Google and you can see here
[246:54.80]CDNJS. Let's copy the CDN of the ACE
[246:58.72]library as you can see. Then go to our
[247:01.60]index.html page and right before our
[247:05.19]script importing let's write in here
[247:08.39]script
[247:10.80]/script and here paste the source into
[247:14.31]the src property or paste this URL into
[247:17.92]the source attribute. Now if we go to
[247:21.27]our code editor
[247:23.43]here and refresh, go to control U, you
[247:28.08]can see now the CDN of the ACE library.
[247:31.19]As you can see, this is all of the code
[247:33.35]of the ACE library or ACE module. Now
[247:37.76]congratulations, we've built this code
[247:39.84]data together. Now your code da is fully
[247:42.64]working, is fully functional, and all
[247:45.19]the functionalities are working 100%.
[247:48.56]So, thank you for watching and see you
[247:50.96]in new tutorials and bye-bye.
